The Washington Post reported in 1998 that \\u201c evidence gathered in federal surveillance intercepts has indicated that the Chinese government planned to increase China \\u2019 s influence in the U.S. political process in 1996 . \\u201d\\nMany people still believe that a major cover-up of that scandal worked \\u2014 in part because the media expressed skepticism and devoted only a fraction of resources they are spending on the Trump\\u2013Russia story . Network reporters expressed outright skepticism of the story , with many openly criticizing the late senator Fred Thompson , the chair of the Senate investigating committee , for wasting time and money . On June 17 , 1997 , Katie Couric , then the Today co-anchor , asked the Washington Post \\u2019 s Bob Woodward about the story : \\u201c Are members of the media , do you think , Bob , too scandal-obsessed , looking for something at every corner ? \\u201d\\nAccording to an analysis by the Media Research Center , the news coverage of the congressional hearings on the China scandal in the summer of 1997 were dwarfed by reports on the murder of fashion designer Gianni Versace and the death of Princess Diana .\\nThe Chinese fundraising scandal involving DNC finance vice chairman John Huang first came to light in the final weeks of the 1996 presidential campaign . A former Commerce Department official , Huang was a top fundraiser who scooped up suspect foreign cash for Team Clinton .\\nA 1998 Senate Government Affairs Committee report on the scandal found \\u201c strong circumstantial evidence \\u201d that a great deal of foreign money had illegally entered the country in an attempt to influence the 1996 election . The DNC was forced to give back more than $ 2.8 million in illegal or improper donations from foreign nationals .\\nThe most suspect funds were brought in by Johnny Chung , a bagman for the Asian billionaire Riady family . Chung confessed that at least $ 35,000 of his donations to the Clinton campaign and the DNC had come from a Chinese aerospace executive \\u2014 a lieutenant colonel in the Chinese military . Chung said the executive had helped him meet three times with General Ji Shengde , the head of Chinese military intelligence . According to Chung \\u2019 s testimony , General Shengde had told him : \\u201c We really like your president . We hope he will be reelected . I will give you $ 300,000 U.S. dollars . You can give it to . . . your president and the Democratic party . \\u201d\\nThe sprawling fundraising scandal ultimately led to 22 guilty pleas on various violations of election laws .\\nThe sprawling fundraising scandal ultimately led to 22 guilty pleas on various violations of election laws . Among the Clinton fundraisers and friends who pleaded guilty were John Huang , Charlie Trie , James Riady , and Michael Brown , son of the late Clinton Commerce secretary Ron Brown . But many questions went unanswered , even after the revelations that Clinton had personally authorized offering donors Oval Office meetings and use of the Lincoln bedroom . A total of 120 participants in the fundraising scandal either fled the country , asserted their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination , or otherwise avoided questioning . The stonewalling worked \\u2014 and probably encouraged Hillary Clinton in her own cover-up of her private e-mail server and her ties with the Clinton Foundation .\\nIndeed , much of the media basically gave the Clintons a pass on evidence that special-interest donors to the Clinton Foundation frequently managed to score favors from the State Department . Journalist Peter Schweitzer revealed in his book Clinton Cash that State had helped move along an infamous deal that granted the Russians control of more than 20 percent of the uranium production here in the United States . The company involved in acquiring the American uranium was a very large donor to \\u2014 you guessed it \\u2014 the Clinton Foundation .\\nNone of this history should dissuade the media from questioning the White House \\u2019 s often shifting and blatantly inaccurate accounts of what happened and who was involved and when . Either the president \\u2019 s team is infected with a self-destructive gene or they really do have something to hide .\\nBut a little humility and honesty on the part of the media would be appropriate . Much of the breathless and constant coverage of the Russia scandal is motivated by the media \\u2019 s hatred of Donald Trump , which is of course reciprocated .\\nWhen it came to the Clintons , the media tended to downplay or even trivialize many of their scandals .\\nWhen it came to the Clintons , the media tended to downplay or even trivialize many of their scandals . But , to be fair , a little bit of self-awareness is beginning to show up in the Russia coverage . Last Thursday , Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC noted that when it came to \\u201c opening the door \\u201d to lowering the standards of conduct by a modern president , Bill Clinton led the way with his lying and scandalous behavior . She was referring , of course , to the Lewinsky scandal , but her comments are equally appropriate to the many other Clinton scandals that didn \\u2019 t receive wall-to-wall coverage .\\n16 Things You Have to Believe to Buy the \\u2018 Witch Hunt \\u2019 Russia Narrative\",\n          \"The supreme justice of Egypt 's Supreme Constitutional Court was sworn in Thursday as the country \\u2019 s interim president after Mohammed Morsi , the country \\u2019 s first democratically elected president , was ousted and reportedly placed in police custody .\\nAdly Mansour was sworn in at the Constitutional Court in a ceremony broadcast live on state television . Mansour will serve as Egypt 's interim leader until a new president is elected . A date for that vote has yet to be set .\\nMorsi was ousted in what was described by the presidential palace as a `` complete military coup . '' The White House has not labeled Morsi ouster a a coup . Doing so would have U.S. aid implications .\\nThe leader of Egypt 's military ousted Morsi from office and replaced him with Mansour late Wednesday evening . The presidential palace immediately branded the move a `` complete military coup . ''\\nA ranking officer in Egypt 's military described the scene to The New York Times . He said , `` We are disciplined , and we have the weapons . That 's what 's on the market right now . Do you see any other solid institution on the scene ? ''\\nIn his first remarks , Mansour praised the massive street demonstrations that led to Morsi 's ouster . He also hailed the youth behind the protests that began on June 30 , saying they embodied `` the nation 's conscience , its ambitions and hopes . ''\\n`` The most glorious thing about June 30 is that it brought together everyone without discrimination or division , '' he said . `` I offer my greetings to the revolutionary people of Egypt . ''\\nManosur 's assumption of office comes a day after the military deposed Morsi , who took office a year ago as Egypt 's first democratically elected president . Morsi was in police custody on Thursday morning after he refused to step down on the orders of Gen. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi .\\nAhmed Aref , a spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood party , told Reuters both Morsi and an aide were being held but he did n't know their location . A security official said they were at a military intelligence facility , Reuters reported .\\nIn announcing Morsi 's ouster earlier Wednesday , Egypt 's top military commander said he had been replaced by the chief justice of the constitutional court as interim head of state .\\nIn addition , Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said the country 's constitution has been temporarily suspended and new elections would be held .\\nAt least 14 people were killed in clashes between Morsi 's supporters and opponents following the announcement , Reuters said , citing the state news agency MENA . Egyptian troops , including commandos in full combat gear , were deployed across much of Cairo , including at key facilities , on bridges over the Nile River and at major intersections\\nEight of the dead were reported to be in the northern city of Marsa Matrouh , with three killed and at least 50 wounded in Alexandria . Another three were killed in the southern city of Minya .\\nIn Washington , President Obama issued a statement Wednesday night saying the administration was `` deeply concerned '' by the decision to remove Morsi and urged the military to avoid `` any arbitrary arrests '' of the president and his supporters .\\nObama also said in light of Morsi 's ouster he had `` directed the relevant departments and agencies to review the implications under U.S. law for our assistance to the government of Egypt . ''\\nAt the same time , a security official in Cairo said the head of Morsi 's Muslim Brotherhood political party and the organization 's deputy chief had been arrested , reportedly in connection with an escape from prison in 2011 .\\nThe state-run newspaper Al-Ahram said arrest warrants were being issued for 300 members of the Brotherhood , Reuters reported .\\nMillions of anti-Morsi protesters in Tahrir Square and around the country erupted in cheers at the news of Morsi 's ouster , setting off fireworks and shouting `` God is great '' and `` Long live Egypt . ''\\nMorsi said on his presidential Facebook page that the military 's action `` represents a military coup and it is unacceptable . ''\\nA U.S. official said nonessential diplomats and embassy families had been ordered to leave Egypt amid the unrest . The State Department issued a warning urging U.S. citizens in the country to leave .\\nWitnesses told Reuters that the army erected barbed wire and barriers around Morsi 's work compound , and moved in vehicles and troops to prevent supporters from getting to his palace .\",\n          \"Barack Obama first captured the national spotlight with a speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention in Boston in which he called for an end to the politics of division . The audience roared back its applause at the end of almost every line :\\nNow even as we speak , there are those who are preparing to divide us , the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes . Well , I say to them tonight , there \\u2019 s not a liberal America and a conservative America ; there \\u2019 s the United States of America . There \\u2019 s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America ; there \\u2019 s the United States of America .\\none people , all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes , all of us defending the United States of America . In the end , that \\u2019 s what this election is about . Do we participate in a politics of cynicism , or do we participate in a politics of hope ?\\nNow , faced with a tough re-election fight , President Obama has , in fundamental respects , adopted the strategy he denounced eight years ago .\\nHe is running a two-track campaign . One track of his re-election drive seeks to boost turnout among core liberal groups ; the other aims to suppress turnout and minimize his margin of defeat in the most hostile segment of the electorate , whites without college degrees .\\nThis approach assumes a highly polarized electorate and tries to make the best of it .\\nOn his campaign web site , Obama singles out 16 specific target constituencies under \\u201c groups. \\u201d Some are listed because it would be politically damaging to fail to include them : People of Faith ; Veterans and Military Families ; Rural Americans ; Seniors ; and Small Business Owners .\\nOthers make up the heart of the liberal-left coalition : African Americans , Environmentalists , Latinos , Young Americans , LGBT Americans , Native Americans , Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders , Educators , Jewish Americans , Nurses and Women .\\nObama is actively courting all of these constituencies : ending the deportation of many young workers who are in the United States illegally ; endorsing same-sex marriage ; loosening work requirements for welfare recipients ; pressing Congress to keep student loan rates low ; rejecting the proposal to build the northern portion of the 1,700 mile Keystone pipeline from Canada to Texas ; and promoting health-care reform that requires insurance plans to fully cover birth control without co-pays or deductibles .\\nInterestingly , the Obama campaign is not spending the lion \\u2019 s share of its money on these groups . Instead , Obama \\u2019 s television ads , at $ 65.6 million the biggest cost of his re-election bid so far , are overwhelmingly aimed at discrediting Mitt Romney .\\nThe negative ads run by the Obama campaign and its allied \\u201c super PAC , \\u201d Priorities USA \\u2014 ads demonizing Romney \\u2014 target not only whites without college degrees , but in particular white men without degrees , a constituency Obama has no hope of winning .\\nThe two anti-Romney commercials that appear to have resonated most powerfully , according to measures of YouTube views , are explicitly aimed at these voters .\\nRomney is particularly vulnerable to a campaign designed to suppress turnout because his support is more tepid than Obama \\u2019 s .\\nThe Priorities USA ad titled \\u201c Stage \\u201d \\u2014 with over 1.4 million views \\u2014 is narrated by Mike Earnest , a middle-aged white working-class man . He describes building a stage at a paper plant in Marion , Ind. , that was in operation 24 hours a day . Shortly afterward , workers from all three shifts were called in . \\u201c A group of people walked out on that stage and told us that the plant is now closed and all of you are fired , \\u201d Earnest says . \\u201c Mitt Romney made over $ 100 million by shutting down our plant and devastated our lives . Turns out when we build that stage it was like building our own coffin , and it just makes me sick . \\u201d\\nAn Obama ad , \\u201c Firms \\u201d with over 1.9 million views , shows Romney singing \\u201c America the Beautiful \\u201d at The Villages , a Florida retirement community . The screen shifts from Romney to images of shuttered factories and empty office rooms , overlaid with a series of headlines , \\u201c In Business , Mitt Romney \\u2019 s Firms Shipped Jobs to Mexico and China , \\u201d \\u201c He Had Millions in a Swiss Bank Account , \\u201d \\u201c Tax Havens Like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands . \\u201d\\nObama \\u2019 s current level of support from white men without college degrees is so low that \\u201c if sustained through Election Day , \\u201d it \\u201c would represent a modern nadir for Democrats , \\u201d Ron Brownstein pointed out earlier this month in the National Journal . Brownstein cited a Quinnipiac poll showing Romney beating Obama 56-29 and a Washington Post/ABC survey putting the contest at 65 for Romney , 28 for Obama among these voters .\\nA central goal of the anti-Romney commercials is to cross-pressure these whites . Persuading more than 28 percent of them to vote for Obama is a tough sell , but the Obama campaign can try to make the alternative , voting for Romney , equally unacceptable . Conflicted voters , especially those holding negative views of both candidates , are likely to skip voting altogether .\\nIn 2004 , for example , in a tactic designed to decrease black turnout , the Bush campaign sent deeply religious black voters mail and email noting Democratic support for same-sex civil unions , with the goal of creating ambivalence toward Senator John F. Kerry . Over the past two years , Republican-controlled state legislatures have been conducting an aggressive vote-suppression strategy of their own through the passage of voter identification laws and laws imposing harsh restrictions on voter registration drives .\\nWhen a top Pennsylvania Republican remarked last month that the state \\u2019 s new voter ID law would help Mitt Romney win Pennsylvania in November , which no Republican presidential candidate has done since 1988 , he reignited a debate over whether the law is intended to curb fraud , as Republicans say , or to depress Democratic turnout , as critics charge .\\nMike Turzai , the House majority leader in Pennsylvania , made the remark when he spoke to a meeting of the Republican State Committee . He ticked off a number of recent conservative achievements by the Republican-led legislature , including , as Turzai put it , \\u201c Voter ID , which is going to allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania , done . \\u201d\\nArthur Lupia , a political scientist at the University of Michigan , has demonstrated that in 2008 , even if Obama had failed to boost turnout among key Democratic groups , he would have won because of the failure of many 2004 George W. Bush supporters to vote for John McCain . \\u201c Bush voters \\u2019 decisions not to vote or to support Obama were a sufficient condition for Obama \\u2019 s victory , \\u201d Lupia wrote in \\u201c Did Bush Voters Cause Obama \\u2019 s Victory ? \\u201d a paper published in PS , the journal of the American Political Science Association .\\nRomney and the Republican Party must achieve the highest possible turnout level among whites . Republicans , including Romney , have adopted anti-immigration stands that have extinguished the possibility of boosting margins among Hispanics . Asian Americans have become increasingly Democratic , self-identifying in public opinion surveys as Democratic rather than Republican by a 52-32 margin . African Americans remain reliably loyal to the Democratic Party by an 86 to 8 percent margin .\\nRomney is particularly vulnerable to a campaign designed to suppress turnout because his support is more tepid than Obama \\u2019 s .\\nA New York Times/CBS poll released on Wednesday found that 52 percent of Obama voters back their candidate strongly , compared to 29 percent of Romney voters . In addition , a third of Romney \\u2019 s voters say they are voting for him because of their dislike of Obama , while only 8 percent of Obama voters are primarily motivated by their hostility to Romney .\\nVote suppression is important for Obama because his numbers among whites without degrees are worsening , despite the omnipresence of anti-Romney ads in the battleground states . Obama \\u2019 s 29 percent level of support among non-college white men in the Quinnipiac poll cited above is a drop from 32 percent in its April survey , and the 28 percent level in the ABC/Washington Post poll is a drop from 34 percent in their May survey .\\nWith his margins in this group falling , Obama directly benefits from every white non-college voter who stays home and does not vote for Romney . The importance of vote suppression in a close contest can be seen in the following hypothetical : say there are 1,000 voters evenly split , 500 to 500 . Candidate A persuades just one of the voters backing his opponent to fail to go to the polls . Candidate A wins 500 to 499 .\\nFor Obama , hurdles in recruiting whites without a college degree are particularly high because of the employment patterns illustrated in this chart produced by RBC Capital Markets , which shows the devastating consequences of the 2008 financial collapse for non-college workers .\\nVoters of all races and ethnicities without college have taken a hit in the job market ; politically , however , the drop in employment is most damaging to Obama among whites . African Americans without college degrees are not only loyal to the Democratic Party , but the election puts at risk a second term for the nation \\u2019 s first black president . Hispanics without college have a president who has taken a liberal stand on immigration reform , backed the DREAM Act and appointed the first Hispanic justice , Sonia Sotomayor , to the Supreme Court .\\nThe problems Obama and the Democratic Party face with white non-college voters have deep roots . A study conducted by political consulting firm CRG Communications for the Democratic National Committee in 1985 reached conclusions about the defection of working class whites to the Republican Party that remain relevant in 2012 . CRG reported that these defectors believed that :\\nthe Democratic Party has not stood with them as they moved from the working to the middle class .

(I know, I know; you're not sure you can wait.)\\n\\nBut while a lot of ink has been spilled in anticipation of how a GOP Congress will clash with Senate Democrats and President Obama, less attention is being paid to what might happen within the Republican Party once the post-victory honeymoon is over. Will a newly unified Congress be the first step toward a final end to the GOP's civil war? Or will GOP leadership soon find that winning in 2014 was the easy part?\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nTo answer those questions and others about our possible near-future, Salon recently spoke with Harvard's Theda Skocpol, the influential professor of sociology and political science who in 2011 released \\\"The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism,\\\" which is still perhaps the definitive analysis of the movement. Our conversation is below and has been edited for clarity and length.\\n\\nA few years ago, back when the Tea Party was relatively new, you and your co-author, Vanessa Williamson, wrote what I still consider to be the most useful in-depth study of the Tea Party. Now that it's been a few years, do you think the media has integrated any of your analysis into how it talks about the Tea Party? Are there any big misconceptions that you think persist?\\n\\nI think it's hard for most analysts in the media to get away from the idea that popularity of the label in national opinion polls, or victory of self-described Tea Party candidates in Republican primaries \\u2014 they tend to treat those as the primary indicators of whether the Tea Party is successful.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nBut as we explained in our book, the Tea Party is a set of organizations, top down and bottom up, that have exerted a lot of leverage on Republican candidates and officeholders. Sometimes they've directly challenged them in primaries \\u2014 and I think those challenges are important \\u2014 but this is a phenomenon that represents the more active half of Republican base voters, and ... their aim has been to get Republican officeholders and candidates to toe a certain policy line, and not to compromise with Democrats. And they've been extremely successful in that. They continue to be very successful.\\n\\nYou hear a narrative sometimes that says that in 2014, unlike 2010 and 2012, the establishment of the Republican Party did a good job of keeping unelectable Tea Party radicals off the ballot. Then, depending on the source, that assertion is sometimes cited as proof that in the war to control the GOP, the establishment won. I'm guessing you disagree?\\n\\nYeah, I don't agree with that at all.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nFirst of all, the so-called unelectable, odd candidates that they're talking about from earlier cycles are people like the woman in Delaware who said she wasn't a witch [Christine O'Donnell], and Todd Akin in Missouri ... It would be hard to say what a Tea Party candidate is, but [Akin and O'Donnell] were as much Christian right candidates [as Tea Party ones], in any event, in terms of where they came from and who they were speaking to in the Republican electorate.\\n\\nMore to the point, [saying the establishment won] is a little bit like noting that a group of generals, after losing most of their army, have retaken a hill, but not noticing that the entire battlefield has switched to the terrain that the opponent wanted it to be fought on. That's what's happened in the Republican Party. It's very hard to find Republican leaders who are not adopting pretty extreme Tea Party positions and policy.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nSo it's a little bit more like they've won the 2014 battle, but in a bigger sense they already lost the war.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt'll be interesting to see what happens after Republicans take the Senate, as I expect that they will do, by two or three or four votes. There are some fairly extreme candidates who have been successful in the Republican primaries this time around who are going to get elected to the Senate and to the House (on top of some very extreme ones who made it even in the last cycle). So I think we're going to see an intensified war inside the Republican Party between the business-oriented wing and those who are beholden either to popular Tea Party forces or to ideological funders.\\n\\nHow big of a role do you think the Tea Party's view of compromise plays in the GOP's internal divisions?\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nIt's very central. A lot of what the leveraging operating that is the Tea Party has been trying to do is to keep Republicans from compromising, either with Democrats in Congress or state legislatures or with, above all, President Obama. They've been pretty successful at that.\\n\\nI've seen the polls showing that Democrats are so much more interested in compromise for its own sake than are Tea Partyers. How much does that have to do with the Tea Party having its own version of recent American history, one in which the country has long been falling apart, partially because of GOP capitulation?\\n\\nCertainly that belief is out there on the far right, [and] it's fanned in the far-right media, too ... There are a lot of Tea Partyers, especially in the grass roots, who see compromise as tantamount to treason, betrayal of the nation.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nBut if that's the way they approach politics, then the argument some people have made that a Republican Senate will lead to more compromise, because the GOP will be expected to govern, doesn't seem likely.\\n\\nThere are going to be a lot of dilemmas.\\n\\nWe know that John Boehner, and presumably Mitch McConnell, are going to be trying to engineer some compromises, particularly on budget issues, and they've already shown some ability to bring enough people along to avoid shutdowns and fiscal cliffs. But what are they going to do with, for example, the fact that their party has promised repeal of Obamacare?\\n\\nThat is s completely disingenuous promise. It is certainly something that these leaders know can't happen. But there's going to be a lot of pressure, not just to hold the symbolic vote that Obama would then veto if it made it to his desk \\u2014 and I'm not sure it would \\u2014 but to start going after major subsidies in the law that benefit millions of voters and benefit businesses that are very uneasy about that Tea Party strand of Republicanism.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nI don't know what's going to happen there \\u2014 and of course that's not even to get to the immigration issue. There are divisions within Tea Party forces on that one, but Republicans have fought an election on a maximalist, deport-them-all platform that just is not going to fly in [2016]. It's already been clear in the last two years that John Boehner cannot control his own caucus. And in the Senate, nobody can really control [anyone]. So I'm not quite sure how that's going to play out.\\n\\nThe Tea Party itself being divided when it comes to immigration reform \\u2014 can you expand on that a bit? The conventional narrative holds that it's the businesspeople, the rich country club-style Republicans, who are for it, and then it's the Tea Party that's against it, and that's that.\\n\\nYou're right that on most issues where divisions are playing out inside the Republican Party, it is business groups \\u2014 who want things like agricultural subsidies and transportation bills and versions of immigration reform \\u2014 against the Tea Party forces that don't.\\n\\nAt least in the work that Vanessa Williamson and I did, we didn't treat the Tea Party ever \\u2014 and I still wouldn't \\u2014 as a unified organization. We all call it \\\"the Tea Party,\\\" but really it's a field of organizations. Some of them are bottom up, grass-roots Tea Party groups, the kind of organized part of the Tea Party half of the Republican electorate. I call those \\\"popular Tea Party forces\\\" ... and they are completely against immigration reform that includes any path to citizenship. I would put that up there right as practically the No. 1 issue in terms of passion at the grass roots.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nOf all possible issues?\\n\\nYeah, pretty much.\\n\\nThe sense that our country's being taken away from us, that a lot of government spending is benefiting undocumented immigrants \\u2014 illegals, in their view \\u2014 and that we must defend the country against this influx, that's very passionate for grass-roots Tea Partyers.\\n\\nBut when we talk about elite forces that have labeled themselves Tea Party supporters and are trying to kind of whip up the fears below and use those fears along with their money and their ideological pressures on the Republican officeholders, they're divided about immigration reform. You can look at the Jim DeMint crowd, and the Heritage Action Foundation, [and see] they staked out a maximalist, nativist position that is really the intellectual justification for the popular passions I described before.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nBut the Koch brothers network, instantiated most clearly at this point in Americans for Prosperity, they don't care what kind of people they exploit. And they're actually in favor of a version of immigration reform that might even include a kind of infinitely winding, very delayed route to some legalizations. Their guy is Paul Ryan (Paul Ryan always follows the Koch brothers' line on everything) and he's made favorable noises.\\n\\nSo it is a split within the elite ranks of Tea Party-aligned forces on immigration, in a way that it really isn't on healthcare reform, where they want to sabotage it. They want to stop it.\\n\\nTo your earlier point about the promise to repeal Obamacare, I assume you've been watching Gov. Kasich's Obamacare two-step?\\n\\n[Laughs] Yeah.\\n\\nDo you think his strategy of pretending the parts of Obamacare he supports \\u2014 like expanding Medicaid or ending rescission \\u2014 aren't really part of the bill; do you think that is going to be a sustainable way future Republicans can thread the needle?\\n\\nWell, Kasich is not the first to do this. We've seen a bunch of them trying this one. Ironically, the closer you get to the actual states, the more they're talking about Medicaid expansion being OK, but it's not Obamacare. That's a little easier to pull off, at least as a public argument, because many states have their own name for Medicaid, and a lot of the voters don't understand what program we're talking about. McConnell's claim that Obamacare was just a website was hilarious. I don't think it's even standing up inside Kentucky right now. I think he's being called on it big-time.\\n\\nIt's just that the minute you get to a position where they can, for example, try to structure budgets, the Tea Party part of the Republican electorate \\u2014 and the large number of Tea Party-oriented legislators that will be in both chambers \\u2014 are going to be pushing vociferously for using 51-vote budget bills to go after the heart of Obamacare. And they're going to say, \\\"Look, you ran on this; you made this promise.\\\" That's true. They have all made that promise. They've all misled the voters about what Obamacare is and about what they're going to do about it.\\n\\nSo the moment of truth is going to come fairly soon, when they're going to have to start engaging in more and more of these kinds of dances that I don't think the right wing of the Republican Party is going to accept. I don't think they're going to be fooled.\",\n          \"President-elect Donald Trump Donald John TrumpSessions says he still supports Trump despite ouster as AG House Republicans voice concerns about White House's impeachment messaging Giuliani consulted with Manafort on Ukraine info: report MORE is drawing praise from the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and other white nationalist groups for appointing former Breitbart executive Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist.\\n\\n\\u201cPerhaps The Donald is for real,\\u201d Rocky Suhayda, chairman of the American Nazi Party, told CNN in an segment that included interviews with several white nationalists.\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s hiring of Bannon has drawn bitter criticism from Democrats, but white nationalists believe it\\u2019s evidence the president-elect intends to live up to his campaign promises to deport illegal immigrants and build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\nDavid Duke, a former KKK leader who lost his Senate bid last week in Louisiana, called Bannon\\u2019s hiring an \\u201cexcellent\\u201d decision.\\n\\nIn March, Trump disavowed David Duke, but only after he stumbled on the issue a few days prior.\\n\\n\\u201cDavid Duke is a bad person, who I disavowed on numerous occasions over the years,\\u201d Trump told MSNBC. \\u201cI disavowed him.

The Washington Post reported in 1998 that \\u201c evidence gathered in federal surveillance intercepts has indicated that the Chinese government planned to increase China \\u2019 s influence in the U.S. political process in 1996 . \\u201d\\nMany people still believe that a major cover-up of that scandal worked \\u2014 in part because the media expressed skepticism and devoted only a fraction of resources they are spending on the Trump\\u2013Russia story . Network reporters expressed outright skepticism of the story , with many openly criticizing the late senator Fred Thompson , the chair of the Senate investigating committee , for wasting time and money . On June 17 , 1997 , Katie Couric , then the Today co-anchor , asked the Washington Post \\u2019 s Bob Woodward about the story : \\u201c Are members of the media , do you think , Bob , too scandal-obsessed , looking for something at every corner ? \\u201d\\nAccording to an analysis by the Media Research Center , the news coverage of the congressional hearings on the China scandal in the summer of 1997 were dwarfed by reports on the murder of fashion designer Gianni Versace and the death of Princess Diana .\\nThe Chinese fundraising scandal involving DNC finance vice chairman John Huang first came to light in the final weeks of the 1996 presidential campaign . A former Commerce Department official , Huang was a top fundraiser who scooped up suspect foreign cash for Team Clinton .\\nA 1998 Senate Government Affairs Committee report on the scandal found \\u201c strong circumstantial evidence \\u201d that a great deal of foreign money had illegally entered the country in an attempt to influence the 1996 election . The DNC was forced to give back more than $ 2.8 million in illegal or improper donations from foreign nationals .\\nThe most suspect funds were brought in by Johnny Chung , a bagman for the Asian billionaire Riady family . Chung confessed that at least $ 35,000 of his donations to the Clinton campaign and the DNC had come from a Chinese aerospace executive \\u2014 a lieutenant colonel in the Chinese military . Chung said the executive had helped him meet three times with General Ji Shengde , the head of Chinese military intelligence . According to Chung \\u2019 s testimony , General Shengde had told him : \\u201c We really like your president . We hope he will be reelected . I will give you $ 300,000 U.S. dollars . You can give it to . . . your president and the Democratic party . \\u201d\\nThe sprawling fundraising scandal ultimately led to 22 guilty pleas on various violations of election laws .\\nThe sprawling fundraising scandal ultimately led to 22 guilty pleas on various violations of election laws . Among the Clinton fundraisers and friends who pleaded guilty were John Huang , Charlie Trie , James Riady , and Michael Brown , son of the late Clinton Commerce secretary Ron Brown . But many questions went unanswered , even after the revelations that Clinton had personally authorized offering donors Oval Office meetings and use of the Lincoln bedroom . A total of 120 participants in the fundraising scandal either fled the country , asserted their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination , or otherwise avoided questioning . The stonewalling worked \\u2014 and probably encouraged Hillary Clinton in her own cover-up of her private e-mail server and her ties with the Clinton Foundation .\\nIndeed , much of the media basically gave the Clintons a pass on evidence that special-interest donors to the Clinton Foundation frequently managed to score favors from the State Department . Journalist Peter Schweitzer revealed in his book Clinton Cash that State had helped move along an infamous deal that granted the Russians control of more than 20 percent of the uranium production here in the United States . The company involved in acquiring the American uranium was a very large donor to \\u2014 you guessed it \\u2014 the Clinton Foundation .\\nNone of this history should dissuade the media from questioning the White House \\u2019 s often shifting and blatantly inaccurate accounts of what happened and who was involved and when . Either the president \\u2019 s team is infected with a self-destructive gene or they really do have something to hide .\\nBut a little humility and honesty on the part of the media would be appropriate . Much of the breathless and constant coverage of the Russia scandal is motivated by the media \\u2019 s hatred of Donald Trump , which is of course reciprocated .\\nWhen it came to the Clintons , the media tended to downplay or even trivialize many of their scandals .\\nWhen it came to the Clintons , the media tended to downplay or even trivialize many of their scandals . But , to be fair , a little bit of self-awareness is beginning to show up in the Russia coverage . Last Thursday , Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC noted that when it came to \\u201c opening the door \\u201d to lowering the standards of conduct by a modern president , Bill Clinton led the way with his lying and scandalous behavior . She was referring , of course , to the Lewinsky scandal , but her comments are equally appropriate to the many other Clinton scandals that didn \\u2019 t receive wall-to-wall coverage .\\n16 Things You Have to Believe to Buy the \\u2018 Witch Hunt \\u2019 Russia Narrative\",\n          \"The supreme justice of Egypt 's Supreme Constitutional Court was sworn in Thursday as the country \\u2019 s interim president after Mohammed Morsi , the country \\u2019 s first democratically elected president , was ousted and reportedly placed in police custody .\\nAdly Mansour was sworn in at the Constitutional Court in a ceremony broadcast live on state television . Mansour will serve as Egypt 's interim leader until a new president is elected . A date for that vote has yet to be set .\\nMorsi was ousted in what was described by the presidential palace as a `` complete military coup . '' The White House has not labeled Morsi ouster a a coup . Doing so would have U.S. aid implications .\\nThe leader of Egypt 's military ousted Morsi from office and replaced him with Mansour late Wednesday evening . The presidential palace immediately branded the move a `` complete military coup . ''\\nA ranking officer in Egypt 's military described the scene to The New York Times . He said , `` We are disciplined , and we have the weapons . That 's what 's on the market right now . Do you see any other solid institution on the scene ? ''\\nIn his first remarks , Mansour praised the massive street demonstrations that led to Morsi 's ouster . He also hailed the youth behind the protests that began on June 30 , saying they embodied `` the nation 's conscience , its ambitions and hopes . ''\\n`` The most glorious thing about June 30 is that it brought together everyone without discrimination or division , '' he said . `` I offer my greetings to the revolutionary people of Egypt . ''\\nManosur 's assumption of office comes a day after the military deposed Morsi , who took office a year ago as Egypt 's first democratically elected president . Morsi was in police custody on Thursday morning after he refused to step down on the orders of Gen. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi .\\nAhmed Aref , a spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood party , told Reuters both Morsi and an aide were being held but he did n't know their location . A security official said they were at a military intelligence facility , Reuters reported .\\nIn announcing Morsi 's ouster earlier Wednesday , Egypt 's top military commander said he had been replaced by the chief justice of the constitutional court as interim head of state .\\nIn addition , Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said the country 's constitution has been temporarily suspended and new elections would be held .\\nAt least 14 people were killed in clashes between Morsi 's supporters and opponents following the announcement , Reuters said , citing the state news agency MENA . Egyptian troops , including commandos in full combat gear , were deployed across much of Cairo , including at key facilities , on bridges over the Nile River and at major intersections\\nEight of the dead were reported to be in the northern city of Marsa Matrouh , with three killed and at least 50 wounded in Alexandria . Another three were killed in the southern city of Minya .\\nIn Washington , President Obama issued a statement Wednesday night saying the administration was `` deeply concerned '' by the decision to remove Morsi and urged the military to avoid `` any arbitrary arrests '' of the president and his supporters .\\nObama also said in light of Morsi 's ouster he had `` directed the relevant departments and agencies to review the implications under U.S. law for our assistance to the government of Egypt . ''\\nAt the same time , a security official in Cairo said the head of Morsi 's Muslim Brotherhood political party and the organization 's deputy chief had been arrested , reportedly in connection with an escape from prison in 2011 .\\nThe state-run newspaper Al-Ahram said arrest warrants were being issued for 300 members of the Brotherhood , Reuters reported .\\nMillions of anti-Morsi protesters in Tahrir Square and around the country erupted in cheers at the news of Morsi 's ouster , setting off fireworks and shouting `` God is great '' and `` Long live Egypt . ''\\nMorsi said on his presidential Facebook page that the military 's action `` represents a military coup and it is unacceptable . ''\\nA U.S. official said nonessential diplomats and embassy families had been ordered to leave Egypt amid the unrest . The State Department issued a warning urging U.S. citizens in the country to leave .\\nWitnesses told Reuters that the army erected barbed wire and barriers around Morsi 's work compound , and moved in vehicles and troops to prevent supporters from getting to his palace .\",\n          \"Barack Obama first captured the national spotlight with a speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention in Boston in which he called for an end to the politics of division . The audience roared back its applause at the end of almost every line :\\nNow even as we speak , there are those who are preparing to divide us , the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes . Well , I say to them tonight , there \\u2019 s not a liberal America and a conservative America ; there \\u2019 s the United States of America . There \\u2019 s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America ; there \\u2019 s the United States of America .\\none people , all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes , all of us defending the United States of America . In the end , that \\u2019 s what this election is about . Do we participate in a politics of cynicism , or do we participate in a politics of hope ?\\nNow , faced with a tough re-election fight , President Obama has , in fundamental respects , adopted the strategy he denounced eight years ago .\\nHe is running a two-track campaign . One track of his re-election drive seeks to boost turnout among core liberal groups ; the other aims to suppress turnout and minimize his margin of defeat in the most hostile segment of the electorate , whites without college degrees .\\nThis approach assumes a highly polarized electorate and tries to make the best of it .\\nOn his campaign web site , Obama singles out 16 specific target constituencies under \\u201c groups. \\u201d Some are listed because it would be politically damaging to fail to include them : People of Faith ; Veterans and Military Families ; Rural Americans ; Seniors ; and Small Business Owners .\\nOthers make up the heart of the liberal-left coalition : African Americans , Environmentalists , Latinos , Young Americans , LGBT Americans , Native Americans , Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders , Educators , Jewish Americans , Nurses and Women .\\nObama is actively courting all of these constituencies : ending the deportation of many young workers who are in the United States illegally ; endorsing same-sex marriage ; loosening work requirements for welfare recipients ; pressing Congress to keep student loan rates low ; rejecting the proposal to build the northern portion of the 1,700 mile Keystone pipeline from Canada to Texas ; and promoting health-care reform that requires insurance plans to fully cover birth control without co-pays or deductibles .\\nInterestingly , the Obama campaign is not spending the lion \\u2019 s share of its money on these groups . Instead , Obama \\u2019 s television ads , at $ 65.6 million the biggest cost of his re-election bid so far , are overwhelmingly aimed at discrediting Mitt Romney .\\nThe negative ads run by the Obama campaign and its allied \\u201c super PAC , \\u201d Priorities USA \\u2014 ads demonizing Romney \\u2014 target not only whites without college degrees , but in particular white men without degrees , a constituency Obama has no hope of winning .\\nThe two anti-Romney commercials that appear to have resonated most powerfully , according to measures of YouTube views , are explicitly aimed at these voters .\\nRomney is particularly vulnerable to a campaign designed to suppress turnout because his support is more tepid than Obama \\u2019 s .\\nThe Priorities USA ad titled \\u201c Stage \\u201d \\u2014 with over 1.4 million views \\u2014 is narrated by Mike Earnest , a middle-aged white working-class man . He describes building a stage at a paper plant in Marion , Ind. , that was in operation 24 hours a day . Shortly afterward , workers from all three shifts were called in . \\u201c A group of people walked out on that stage and told us that the plant is now closed and all of you are fired , \\u201d Earnest says . \\u201c Mitt Romney made over $ 100 million by shutting down our plant and devastated our lives . Turns out when we build that stage it was like building our own coffin , and it just makes me sick . \\u201d\\nAn Obama ad , \\u201c Firms \\u201d with over 1.9 million views , shows Romney singing \\u201c America the Beautiful \\u201d at The Villages , a Florida retirement community . The screen shifts from Romney to images of shuttered factories and empty office rooms , overlaid with a series of headlines , \\u201c In Business , Mitt Romney \\u2019 s Firms Shipped Jobs to Mexico and China , \\u201d \\u201c He Had Millions in a Swiss Bank Account , \\u201d \\u201c Tax Havens Like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands . \\u201d\\nObama \\u2019 s current level of support from white men without college degrees is so low that \\u201c if sustained through Election Day , \\u201d it \\u201c would represent a modern nadir for Democrats , \\u201d Ron Brownstein pointed out earlier this month in the National Journal . Brownstein cited a Quinnipiac poll showing Romney beating Obama 56-29 and a Washington Post/ABC survey putting the contest at 65 for Romney , 28 for Obama among these voters .\\nA central goal of the anti-Romney commercials is to cross-pressure these whites . Persuading more than 28 percent of them to vote for Obama is a tough sell , but the Obama campaign can try to make the alternative , voting for Romney , equally unacceptable . Conflicted voters , especially those holding negative views of both candidates , are likely to skip voting altogether .\\nIn 2004 , for example , in a tactic designed to decrease black turnout , the Bush campaign sent deeply religious black voters mail and email noting Democratic support for same-sex civil unions , with the goal of creating ambivalence toward Senator John F. Kerry . Over the past two years , Republican-controlled state legislatures have been conducting an aggressive vote-suppression strategy of their own through the passage of voter identification laws and laws imposing harsh restrictions on voter registration drives .\\nWhen a top Pennsylvania Republican remarked last month that the state \\u2019 s new voter ID law would help Mitt Romney win Pennsylvania in November , which no Republican presidential candidate has done since 1988 , he reignited a debate over whether the law is intended to curb fraud , as Republicans say , or to depress Democratic turnout , as critics charge .\\nMike Turzai , the House majority leader in Pennsylvania , made the remark when he spoke to a meeting of the Republican State Committee . He ticked off a number of recent conservative achievements by the Republican-led legislature , including , as Turzai put it , \\u201c Voter ID , which is going to allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania , done . \\u201d\\nArthur Lupia , a political scientist at the University of Michigan , has demonstrated that in 2008 , even if Obama had failed to boost turnout among key Democratic groups , he would have won because of the failure of many 2004 George W. Bush supporters to vote for John McCain . \\u201c Bush voters \\u2019 decisions not to vote or to support Obama were a sufficient condition for Obama \\u2019 s victory , \\u201d Lupia wrote in \\u201c Did Bush Voters Cause Obama \\u2019 s Victory ? \\u201d a paper published in PS , the journal of the American Political Science Association .\\nRomney and the Republican Party must achieve the highest possible turnout level among whites . Republicans , including Romney , have adopted anti-immigration stands that have extinguished the possibility of boosting margins among Hispanics . Asian Americans have become increasingly Democratic , self-identifying in public opinion surveys as Democratic rather than Republican by a 52-32 margin . African Americans remain reliably loyal to the Democratic Party by an 86 to 8 percent margin .\\nRomney is particularly vulnerable to a campaign designed to suppress turnout because his support is more tepid than Obama \\u2019 s .\\nA New York Times/CBS poll released on Wednesday found that 52 percent of Obama voters back their candidate strongly , compared to 29 percent of Romney voters . In addition , a third of Romney \\u2019 s voters say they are voting for him because of their dislike of Obama , while only 8 percent of Obama voters are primarily motivated by their hostility to Romney .\\nVote suppression is important for Obama because his numbers among whites without degrees are worsening , despite the omnipresence of anti-Romney ads in the battleground states . Obama \\u2019 s 29 percent level of support among non-college white men in the Quinnipiac poll cited above is a drop from 32 percent in its April survey , and the 28 percent level in the ABC/Washington Post poll is a drop from 34 percent in their May survey .\\nWith his margins in this group falling , Obama directly benefits from every white non-college voter who stays home and does not vote for Romney . The importance of vote suppression in a close contest can be seen in the following hypothetical : say there are 1,000 voters evenly split , 500 to 500 . Candidate A persuades just one of the voters backing his opponent to fail to go to the polls . Candidate A wins 500 to 499 .\\nFor Obama , hurdles in recruiting whites without a college degree are particularly high because of the employment patterns illustrated in this chart produced by RBC Capital Markets , which shows the devastating consequences of the 2008 financial collapse for non-college workers .\\nVoters of all races and ethnicities without college have taken a hit in the job market ; politically , however , the drop in employment is most damaging to Obama among whites . African Americans without college degrees are not only loyal to the Democratic Party , but the election puts at risk a second term for the nation \\u2019 s first black president . Hispanics without college have a president who has taken a liberal stand on immigration reform , backed the DREAM Act and appointed the first Hispanic justice , Sonia Sotomayor , to the Supreme Court .\\nThe problems Obama and the Democratic Party face with white non-college voters have deep roots . A study conducted by political consulting firm CRG Communications for the Democratic National Committee in 1985 reached conclusions about the defection of working class whites to the Republican Party that remain relevant in 2012 . CRG reported that these defectors believed that :\\nthe Democratic Party has not stood with them as they moved from the working to the middle class . They have a whole set of middle class economic problems today , and the Democratic Party is not helping them . Instead it is helping the blacks , Hispanics and the poor . They feel betrayed .\\nLooked at this way , CRG reported , key Democratic constituencies \\u2014 affluent liberals , gay rights activists , ethnic and racial minorities \\u2014 were \\u201c leaving the \\u2018 common man \\u2019 out of the picture . \\u201d\\nDemographic trends \\u2014 the steady decline of the share of the population made up of non-college whites , from 86 percent in 1940 to 48 percent in 2007 \\u2013 have made winning these voters by increasingly large margins crucial to the Republican Party , while diminishing the Democratic Party \\u2019 s need for their support .\\nThe 2012 election will be another test of strength in the decade-long competition between this white voting bloc \\u2014 which dominated in 2002 , 2004 and 2010 \\u2014 and such ascendant Democratic constituencies as Hispanics , college-educated women and young voters , who flexed their muscles in 2006 and 2008 .\\nThomas B.

The Washington Post reported in 1998 that \\u201c evidence gathered in federal surveillance intercepts has indicated that the Chinese government planned to increase China \\u2019 s influence in the U.S. political process in 1996 . \\u201d\\nMany people still believe that a major cover-up of that scandal worked \\u2014 in part because the media expressed skepticism and devoted only a fraction of resources they are spending on the Trump\\u2013Russia story . Network reporters expressed outright skepticism of the story , with many openly criticizing the late senator Fred Thompson , the chair of the Senate investigating committee , for wasting time and money . On June 17 , 1997 , Katie Couric , then the Today co-anchor , asked the Washington Post \\u2019 s Bob Woodward about the story : \\u201c Are members of the media , do you think , Bob , too scandal-obsessed , looking for something at every corner ? \\u201d\\nAccording to an analysis by the Media Research Center , the news coverage of the congressional hearings on the China scandal in the summer of 1997 were dwarfed by reports on the murder of fashion designer Gianni Versace and the death of Princess Diana .\\nThe Chinese fundraising scandal involving DNC finance vice chairman John Huang first came to light in the final weeks of the 1996 presidential campaign . A former Commerce Department official , Huang was a top fundraiser who scooped up suspect foreign cash for Team Clinton .\\nA 1998 Senate Government Affairs Committee report on the scandal found \\u201c strong circumstantial evidence \\u201d that a great deal of foreign money had illegally entered the country in an attempt to influence the 1996 election . The DNC was forced to give back more than $ 2.8 million in illegal or improper donations from foreign nationals .\\nThe most suspect funds were brought in by Johnny Chung , a bagman for the Asian billionaire Riady family . Chung confessed that at least $ 35,000 of his donations to the Clinton campaign and the DNC had come from a Chinese aerospace executive \\u2014 a lieutenant colonel in the Chinese military . Chung said the executive had helped him meet three times with General Ji Shengde , the head of Chinese military intelligence . According to Chung \\u2019 s testimony , General Shengde had told him : \\u201c We really like your president . We hope he will be reelected . I will give you $ 300,000 U.S. dollars . You can give it to . . . your president and the Democratic party . \\u201d\\nThe sprawling fundraising scandal ultimately led to 22 guilty pleas on various violations of election laws .\\nThe sprawling fundraising scandal ultimately led to 22 guilty pleas on various violations of election laws . Among the Clinton fundraisers and friends who pleaded guilty were John Huang , Charlie Trie , James Riady , and Michael Brown , son of the late Clinton Commerce secretary Ron Brown . But many questions went unanswered , even after the revelations that Clinton had personally authorized offering donors Oval Office meetings and use of the Lincoln bedroom . A total of 120 participants in the fundraising scandal either fled the country , asserted their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination , or otherwise avoided questioning . The stonewalling worked \\u2014 and probably encouraged Hillary Clinton in her own cover-up of her private e-mail server and her ties with the Clinton Foundation .\\nIndeed , much of the media basically gave the Clintons a pass on evidence that special-interest donors to the Clinton Foundation frequently managed to score favors from the State Department .

The audience roared back its applause at the end of almost every line :\\nNow even as we speak , there are those who are preparing to divide us , the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes . Well , I say to them tonight , there \\u2019 s not a liberal America and a conservative America ; there \\u2019 s the United States of America .

In the end , that \\u2019 s what this election is about . Do we participate in a politics of cynicism , or do we participate in a politics of hope ?\\nNow , faced with a tough re-election fight , President Obama has , in fundamental respects , adopted the strategy he denounced eight years ago .\\nHe is running a two-track campaign . One track of his re-election drive seeks to boost turnout among core liberal groups ; the other aims to suppress turnout and minimize his margin of defeat in the most hostile segment of the electorate , whites without college degrees .\\nThis approach assumes a highly polarized electorate and tries to make the best of it .\\nOn his campaign web site , Obama singles out 16 specific target constituencies under \\u201c groups. \\u201d Some are listed because it would be politically damaging to fail to include them : People of Faith ; Veterans and Military Families ; Rural Americans ; Seniors ; and Small Business Owners .\\nOthers make up the heart of the liberal-left coalition : African Americans , Environmentalists , Latinos , Young Americans , LGBT Americans , Native Americans , Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders , Educators , Jewish Americans , Nurses and Women .\\nObama is actively courting all of these constituencies : ending the deportation of many young workers who are in the United States illegally ; endorsing same-sex marriage ; loosening work requirements for welfare recipients ; pressing Congress to keep student loan rates low ; rejecting the proposal to build the northern portion of the 1,700 mile Keystone pipeline from Canada to Texas ; and promoting health-care reform that requires insurance plans to fully cover birth control without co-pays or deductibles .\\nInterestingly , the Obama campaign is not spending the lion \\u2019 s share of its money on these groups . Instead , Obama \\u2019 s television ads , at $ 65.6 million the biggest cost of his re-election bid so far , are overwhelmingly aimed at discrediting Mitt Romney .\\nThe negative ads run by the Obama campaign and its allied \\u201c super PAC , \\u201d Priorities USA \\u2014 ads demonizing Romney \\u2014 target not only whites without college degrees , but in particular white men without degrees , a constituency Obama has no hope of winning .\\nThe two anti-Romney commercials that appear to have resonated most powerfully , according to measures of YouTube views , are explicitly aimed at these voters .\\nRomney is particularly vulnerable to a campaign designed to suppress turnout because his support is more tepid than Obama \\u2019 s .\\nThe Priorities USA ad titled \\u201c Stage \\u201d \\u2014 with over 1.4 million views \\u2014 is narrated by Mike Earnest , a middle-aged white working-class man . He describes building a stage at a paper plant in Marion , Ind. , that was in operation 24 hours a day . Shortly afterward , workers from all three shifts were called in . \\u201c A group of people walked out on that stage and told us that the plant is now closed and all of you are fired , \\u201d Earnest says . \\u201c Mitt Romney made over $ 100 million by shutting down our plant and devastated our lives . Turns out when we build that stage it was like building our own coffin , and it just makes me sick . \\u201d\\nAn Obama ad , \\u201c Firms \\u201d with over 1.9 million views , shows Romney singing \\u201c America the Beautiful \\u201d at The Villages , a Florida retirement community . The screen shifts from Romney to images of shuttered factories and empty office rooms , overlaid with a series of headlines , \\u201c In Business , Mitt Romney \\u2019 s Firms Shipped Jobs to Mexico and China , \\u201d \\u201c He Had Millions in a Swiss Bank Account , \\u201d \\u201c Tax Havens Like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands . \\u201d\\nObama \\u2019 s current level of support from white men without college degrees is so low that \\u201c if sustained through Election Day , \\u201d it \\u201c would represent a modern nadir for Democrats , \\u201d Ron Brownstein pointed out earlier this month in the National Journal . Brownstein cited a Quinnipiac poll showing Romney beating Obama 56-29 and a Washington Post/ABC survey putting the contest at 65 for Romney , 28 for Obama among these voters .\\nA central goal of the anti-Romney commercials is to cross-pressure these whites . Persuading more than 28 percent of them to vote for Obama is a tough sell , but the Obama campaign can try to make the alternative , voting for Romney , equally unacceptable . Conflicted voters , especially those holding negative views of both candidates , are likely to skip voting altogether .\\nIn 2004 , for example , in a tactic designed to decrease black turnout , the Bush campaign sent deeply religious black voters mail and email noting Democratic support for same-sex civil unions , with the goal of creating ambivalence toward Senator John F. Kerry . Over the past two years , Republican-controlled state legislatures have been conducting an aggressive vote-suppression strategy of their own through the passage of voter identification laws and laws imposing harsh restrictions on voter registration drives .\\nWhen a top Pennsylvania Republican remarked last month that the state \\u2019 s new voter ID law would help Mitt Romney win Pennsylvania in November , which no Republican presidential candidate has done since 1988 , he reignited a debate over whether the law is intended to curb fraud , as Republicans say , or to depress Democratic turnout , as critics charge .\\nMike Turzai , the House majority leader in Pennsylvania , made the remark when he spoke to a meeting of the Republican State Committee . He ticked off a number of recent conservative achievements by the Republican-led legislature , including , as Turzai put it , \\u201c Voter ID , which is going to allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania , done . \\u201d\\nArthur Lupia , a political scientist at the University of Michigan , has demonstrated that in 2008 , even if Obama had failed to boost turnout among key Democratic groups , he would have won because of the failure of many 2004 George W. Bush supporters to vote for John McCain . \\u201c Bush voters \\u2019 decisions not to vote or to support Obama were a sufficient condition for Obama \\u2019 s victory , \\u201d Lupia wrote in \\u201c Did Bush Voters Cause Obama \\u2019 s Victory ? \\u201d a paper published in PS , the journal of the American Political Science Association .\\nRomney and the Republican Party must achieve the highest possible turnout level among whites . Republicans , including Romney , have adopted anti-immigration stands that have extinguished the possibility of boosting margins among Hispanics . Asian Americans have become increasingly Democratic , self-identifying in public opinion surveys as Democratic rather than Republican by a 52-32 margin . African Americans remain reliably loyal to the Democratic Party by an 86 to 8 percent margin .\\nRomney is particularly vulnerable to a campaign designed to suppress turnout because his support is more tepid than Obama \\u2019 s .\\nA New York Times/CBS poll released on Wednesday found that 52 percent of Obama voters back their candidate strongly , compared to 29 percent of Romney voters . In addition , a third of Romney \\u2019 s voters say they are voting for him because of their dislike of Obama , while only 8 percent of Obama voters are primarily motivated by their hostility to Romney .\\nVote suppression is important for Obama because his numbers among whites without degrees are worsening , despite the omnipresence of anti-Romney ads in the battleground states . Obama \\u2019 s 29 percent level of support among non-college white men in the Quinnipiac poll cited above is a drop from 32 percent in its April survey , and the 28 percent level in the ABC/Washington Post poll is a drop from 34 percent in their May survey .\\nWith his margins in this group falling , Obama directly benefits from every white non-college voter who stays home and does not vote for Romney . The importance of vote suppression in a close contest can be seen in the following hypothetical : say there are 1,000 voters evenly split , 500 to 500 . Candidate A persuades just one of the voters backing his opponent to fail to go to the polls . Candidate A wins 500 to 499 .\\nFor Obama , hurdles in recruiting whites without a college degree are particularly high because of the employment patterns illustrated in this chart produced by RBC Capital Markets , which shows the devastating consequences of the 2008 financial collapse for non-college workers .\\nVoters of all races and ethnicities without college have taken a hit in the job market ; politically , however , the drop in employment is most damaging to Obama among whites . African Americans without college degrees are not only loyal to the Democratic Party , but the election puts at risk a second term for the nation \\u2019 s first black president . Hispanics without college have a president who has taken a liberal stand on immigration reform , backed the DREAM Act and appointed the first Hispanic justice , Sonia Sotomayor , to the Supreme Court .\\nThe problems Obama and the Democratic Party face with white non-college voters have deep roots . A study conducted by political consulting firm CRG Communications for the Democratic National Committee in 1985 reached conclusions about the defection of working class whites to the Republican Party that remain relevant in 2012 . CRG reported that these defectors believed that :\\nthe Democratic Party has not stood with them as they moved from the working to the middle class . They have a whole set of middle class economic problems today , and the Democratic Party is not helping them . Instead it is helping the blacks , Hispanics and the poor . They feel betrayed .\\nLooked at this way , CRG reported , key Democratic constituencies \\u2014 affluent liberals , gay rights activists , ethnic and racial minorities \\u2014 were \\u201c leaving the \\u2018 common man \\u2019 out of the picture . \\u201d\\nDemographic trends \\u2014 the steady decline of the share of the population made up of non-college whites , from 86 percent in 1940 to 48 percent in 2007 \\u2013 have made winning these voters by increasingly large margins crucial to the Republican Party , while diminishing the Democratic Party \\u2019 s need for their support .\\nThe 2012 election will be another test of strength in the decade-long competition between this white voting bloc \\u2014 which dominated in 2002 , 2004 and 2010 \\u2014 and such ascendant Democratic constituencies as Hispanics , college-educated women and young voters , who flexed their muscles in 2006 and 2008 .\\nThomas B.

The Washington Post reported in 1998 that \\u201c evidence gathered in federal surveillance intercepts has indicated that the Chinese government planned to increase China \\u2019 s influence in the U.S. political process in 1996 . \\u201d\\nMany people still believe that a major cover-up of that scandal worked \\u2014 in part because the media expressed skepticism and devoted only a fraction of resources they are spending on the Trump\\u2013Russia story . Network reporters expressed outright skepticism of the story , with many openly criticizing the late senator Fred Thompson , the chair of the Senate investigating committee , for wasting time and money . On June 17 , 1997 , Katie Couric , then the Today co-anchor , asked the Washington Post \\u2019 s Bob Woodward about the story : \\u201c Are members of the media , do you think , Bob , too scandal-obsessed , looking for something at every corner ? \\u201d\\nAccording to an analysis by the Media Research Center , the news coverage of the congressional hearings on the China scandal in the summer of 1997 were dwarfed by reports on the murder of fashion designer Gianni Versace and the death of Princess Diana .\\nThe Chinese fundraising scandal involving DNC finance vice chairman John Huang first came to light in the final weeks of the 1996 presidential campaign . A former Commerce Department official , Huang was a top fundraiser who scooped up suspect foreign cash for Team Clinton .\\nA 1998 Senate Government Affairs Committee report on the scandal found \\u201c strong circumstantial evidence \\u201d that a great deal of foreign money had illegally entered the country in an attempt to influence the 1996 election . The DNC was forced to give back more than $ 2.8 million in illegal or improper donations from foreign nationals .\\nThe most suspect funds were brought in by Johnny Chung , a bagman for the Asian billionaire Riady family . Chung confessed that at least $ 35,000 of his donations to the Clinton campaign and the DNC had come from a Chinese aerospace executive \\u2014 a lieutenant colonel in the Chinese military . Chung said the executive had helped him meet three times with General Ji Shengde , the head of Chinese military intelligence . According to Chung \\u2019 s testimony , General Shengde had told him : \\u201c We really like your president . We hope he will be reelected . I will give you $ 300,000 U.S. dollars . You can give it to . . . your president and the Democratic party . \\u201d\\nThe sprawling fundraising scandal ultimately led to 22 guilty pleas on various violations of election laws .\\nThe sprawling fundraising scandal ultimately led to 22 guilty pleas on various violations of election laws . Among the Clinton fundraisers and friends who pleaded guilty were John Huang , Charlie Trie , James Riady , and Michael Brown , son of the late Clinton Commerce secretary Ron Brown . But many questions went unanswered , even after the revelations that Clinton had personally authorized offering donors Oval Office meetings and use of the Lincoln bedroom . A total of 120 participants in the fundraising scandal either fled the country , asserted their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination , or otherwise avoided questioning . The stonewalling worked \\u2014 and probably encouraged Hillary Clinton in her own cover-up of her private e-mail server and her ties with the Clinton Foundation .\\nIndeed , much of the media basically gave the Clintons a pass on evidence that special-interest donors to the Clinton Foundation frequently managed to score favors from the State Department . Journalist Peter Schweitzer revealed in his book Clinton Cash that State had helped move along an infamous deal that granted the Russians control of more than 20 percent of the uranium production here in the United States .

The screen shifts from Romney to images of shuttered factories and empty office rooms , overlaid with a series of headlines , \\u201c In Business , Mitt Romney \\u2019 s Firms Shipped Jobs to Mexico and China , \\u201d \\u201c He Had Millions in a Swiss Bank Account , \\u201d \\u201c Tax Havens Like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands . \\u201d\\nObama \\u2019 s current level of support from white men without college degrees is so low that \\u201c if sustained through Election Day , \\u201d it \\u201c would represent a modern nadir for Democrats , \\u201d Ron Brownstein pointed out earlier this month in the National Journal . Brownstein cited a Quinnipiac poll showing Romney beating Obama 56-29 and a Washington Post/ABC survey putting the contest at 65 for Romney , 28 for Obama among these voters .\\nA central goal of the anti-Romney commercials is to cross-pressure these whites . Persuading more than 28 percent of them to vote for Obama is a tough sell , but the Obama campaign can try to make the alternative , voting for Romney , equally unacceptable . Conflicted voters , especially those holding negative views of both candidates , are likely to skip voting altogether .\\nIn 2004 , for example , in a tactic designed to decrease black turnout , the Bush campaign sent deeply religious black voters mail and email noting Democratic support for same-sex civil unions , with the goal of creating ambivalence toward Senator John F. Kerry . Over the past two years , Republican-controlled state legislatures have been conducting an aggressive vote-suppression strategy of their own through the passage of voter identification laws and laws imposing harsh restrictions on voter registration drives .\\nWhen a top Pennsylvania Republican remarked last month that the state \\u2019 s new voter ID law would help Mitt Romney win Pennsylvania in November , which no Republican presidential candidate has done since 1988 , he reignited a debate over whether the law is intended to curb fraud , as Republicans say , or to depress Democratic turnout , as critics charge .\\nMike Turzai , the House majority leader in Pennsylvania , made the remark when he spoke to a meeting of the Republican State Committee . He ticked off a number of recent conservative achievements by the Republican-led legislature , including , as Turzai put it , \\u201c Voter ID , which is going to allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania , done . \\u201d\\nArthur Lupia , a political scientist at the University of Michigan , has demonstrated that in 2008 , even if Obama had failed to boost turnout among key Democratic groups , he would have won because of the failure of many 2004 George W. Bush supporters to vote for John McCain . \\u201c Bush voters \\u2019 decisions not to vote or to support Obama were a sufficient condition for Obama \\u2019 s victory , \\u201d Lupia wrote in \\u201c Did Bush Voters Cause Obama \\u2019 s Victory ? \\u201d a paper published in PS , the journal of the American Political Science Association .\\nRomney and the Republican Party must achieve the highest possible turnout level among whites . Republicans , including Romney , have adopted anti-immigration stands that have extinguished the possibility of boosting margins among Hispanics . Asian Americans have become increasingly Democratic , self-identifying in public opinion surveys as Democratic rather than Republican by a 52-32 margin . African Americans remain reliably loyal to the Democratic Party by an 86 to 8 percent margin .\\nRomney is particularly vulnerable to a campaign designed to suppress turnout because his support is more tepid than Obama \\u2019 s .\\nA New York Times/CBS poll released on Wednesday found that 52 percent of Obama voters back their candidate strongly , compared to 29 percent of Romney voters . In addition , a third of Romney \\u2019 s voters say they are voting for him because of their dislike of Obama , while only 8 percent of Obama voters are primarily motivated by their hostility to Romney .\\nVote suppression is important for Obama because his numbers among whites without degrees are worsening , despite the omnipresence of anti-Romney ads in the battleground states . Obama \\u2019 s 29 percent level of support among non-college white men in the Quinnipiac poll cited above is a drop from 32 percent in its April survey , and the 28 percent level in the ABC/Washington Post poll is a drop from 34 percent in their May survey .\\nWith his margins in this group falling , Obama directly benefits from every white non-college voter who stays home and does not vote for Romney . The importance of vote suppression in a close contest can be seen in the following hypothetical : say there are 1,000 voters evenly split , 500 to 500 . Candidate A persuades just one of the voters backing his opponent to fail to go to the polls . Candidate A wins 500 to 499 .\\nFor Obama , hurdles in recruiting whites without a college degree are particularly high because of the employment patterns illustrated in this chart produced by RBC Capital Markets , which shows the devastating consequences of the 2008 financial collapse for non-college workers .\\nVoters of all races and ethnicities without college have taken a hit in the job market ; politically , however , the drop in employment is most damaging to Obama among whites . African Americans without college degrees are not only loyal to the Democratic Party , but the election puts at risk a second term for the nation \\u2019 s first black president . Hispanics without college have a president who has taken a liberal stand on immigration reform , backed the DREAM Act and appointed the first Hispanic justice , Sonia Sotomayor , to the Supreme Court .\\nThe problems Obama and the Democratic Party face with white non-college voters have deep roots . A study conducted by political consulting firm CRG Communications for the Democratic National Committee in 1985 reached conclusions about the defection of working class whites to the Republican Party that remain relevant in 2012 . CRG reported that these defectors believed that :\\nthe Democratic Party has not stood with them as they moved from the working to the middle class . They have a whole set of middle class economic problems today , and the Democratic Party is not helping them . Instead it is helping the blacks , Hispanics and the poor . They feel betrayed .\\nLooked at this way , CRG reported , key Democratic constituencies \\u2014 affluent liberals , gay rights activists , ethnic and racial minorities \\u2014 were \\u201c leaving the \\u2018 common man \\u2019 out of the picture . \\u201d\\nDemographic trends \\u2014 the steady decline of the share of the population made up of non-college whites , from 86 percent in 1940 to 48 percent in 2007 \\u2013 have made winning these voters by increasingly large margins crucial to the Republican Party , while diminishing the Democratic Party \\u2019 s need for their support .\\nThe 2012 election will be another test of strength in the decade-long competition between this white voting bloc \\u2014 which dominated in 2002 , 2004 and 2010 \\u2014 and such ascendant Democratic constituencies as Hispanics , college-educated women and young voters , who flexed their muscles in 2006 and 2008 .\\nThomas B. Edsall , a professor of journalism at Columbia University , is the author of the book \\u201c The Age of Austerity : How Scarcity Will Remake American Politics , \\u201d which was published earlier this year .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
