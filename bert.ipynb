He is under pressure by President Donald Trump to pass a healthcare bill and make good on Republicans \\u2019 seven-year mission to gut Democratic former President Barack Obama \\u2019 s signature legislative achievement .\\n\\u201c The American people deserve better than the pain of Obamacare . They deserve better care . And the time to deliver that to them is next week , \\u201d McConnell said .\\nIn addition to the criticism from some senators , a major hospital association and one large insurer said the measure falls short in critical areas .\\nWith Democrats united against it , McConnell can not afford to lose more than two Republican senators to win passage . But moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul voiced opposition to even bringing the new plan up for debate .\\nSeveral senators said they had concerns about the legislation , particularly its Medicaid cuts , including Shelley Moore Capito , Rob Portman and John McCain . And two other Republican senators , Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy , complicated matters by announcing an alternative plan .\\nMcConnell , a skillful tactician who was forced two weeks ago to scrub a planned vote on an earlier version opposed by both moderates and hard-line conservatives in his party , has planned for a vote on the retooled bill next week .\\nThe continuing lack of consensus among Republicans on what to do with Obamacare after calling for its demise since 2010 shows that it is no sure thing that Trump \\u2019 s party will be able to get the job done .\\nHealthcare is Trump \\u2019 s first major legislative initiative . Failure would call into question his party \\u2019 s ability to govern despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House .\\nThe measure represents a retreat from long-standing Republican aspirations to dump Obamacare-related taxes .\\nIt retains two taxes on the wealthy that helped pay for the Obamacare law that the previous version would have repealed , and also keeps Obamacare \\u2019 s limits on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry .\\nThe bill included a provision allowing insurers to offer stripped-down , low-cost healthcare plans - a measure proposed by Senator Ted Cruz to try to win over holdout conservatives .\\nThese \\u201c skinny plans \\u201d would not have to cover the broad benefits mandated under Obamacare like maternity and newborn care , mental health services and addiction treatment , outpatient care , hospitalization , emergency room visits and prescription drugs .\\nInsurer groups , including the national Blue Cross Blue Shield Association , have derided the skinny plans , saying they would raise insurance premiums , destabilize the individual insurance market and undermine protections for pre-existing medical conditions . Moderate senators could balk at the provision for the same reasons .\\nThe new bill provides an additional $ 70 billion to help stabilize the individual insurance market on top of the $ 112 billion in the original bill to help insurers slow growth in premium costs and help lower-income insurance holders cover out-of-pocket medical expenses .\\nThe bill would phase out the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and disabled , and includes sharp cuts to federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025 .\\nModerate Republicans were spurned in their desire to see a reduction in Medicaid cuts in the revised version .\\nCritics said despite some changes to coax wavering senators , the revised bill \\u2019 s core remains unchanged : restructuring and cutting the critical Medicaid social safety-net program , taking away insurance from millions of Americans and driving up healthcare costs for millions of the most vulnerable Americans , especially older people and the sick .\\nU.S . Senator Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) ( C ) is surrounded by reporters as he arrives for a meeting of the Senate Republican caucus for an expected unveiling of Senate Republicans ' revamped proposal to replace Obamacare health care legislation at the U.S. Capitol in Washington , U.S. July 13 , 2017 . \\u2588\\u2588\\u2588/Jonathan Ernst\\nThe revamped bill contains a provision that appears to be aimed at winning over Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , a moderate who had opposed the original bill . It would funnel additional money to states that have higher insurance premiums \\u2013 at least 75 percent above the national average . Alaska is the only state with premiums that high , Senate aides said .\\nHospital and insurer groups have spoken out against the Senate Republican approach , particularly proposed Medicaid cuts . The cuts would result in lower revenues for hospital companies like Community Health Systems Inc and Medicaid insurance specialists like Molina Healthcare and Centene Corp .\\nMolina Healthcare , which has more than 1 million customers on the Obamacare individual exchanges and manages Medicaid health programs , said the changes would leave insurers competing for the least risky customers and would make plans for sick people unaffordable .\\nThe American Hospital Association said the new version of the bill retained the \\u201c unacceptable flaws \\u201d of the previous version .\\n\\u201c Instead of merely putting forth an update , we again call on the Senate to put forth an upgrade , \\u201d Rick Pollack , president of the association , said in a statement .\\nHealthcare stocks were mostly unmoved by the announcement , as Wall Street analysts described the core of the revised bill as largely unchanged from the earlier one .\\nThe new bill includes another $ 45 billion for fighting the opioid addiction epidemic , on top of the $ 2 billion in the earlier version .\\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , which forecast that the previous version would have increased the number of Americans without health insurance by 22 million by 2026 , is due to evaluate the new bill in coming days .\\nThe Affordable Care Act , dubbed Obamacare , expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million people , in large part by expanding Medicaid .\\nThe House of Representatives on May 4 passed its own version of healthcare legislation .\\nRepublicans have a 52-48 Senate majority , with Vice President Mike Pence able to cast a potential tie-breaking vote . Any bill passed by the Senate would have to go back to the House for approval .\\nRepealing and replacing Obamacare , which Republicans fault as a costly government intrusion into the healthcare system , was a top campaign promise for Trump , who was monitoring the Senate developments during his visit to Paris .\\n\\u201c I \\u2019 d say the only thing more difficult than peace between Israel and the Palestinians is healthcare , \\u201d Trump told reporters on his flight to Paris .\\n( Corrects 20th paragraph to show the bill applies to states with premiums at least 75 percent above the national average , not 75 percent of the national average )\",\n          \"House Republicans are coming under growing pressure to release their ObamaCare repeal and replace plan ahead of committee markups that could begin next week .\\nEven some Republican lawmakers are criticizing their party for the lack of access to the House Energy and Commerce Committee 's draft bill , which is apparently being kept in a designated room in the Capitol where entry is limited to certain members .\\n\\u201c We want to see the bill . We have many objections , \\u201d Sen. Rand Paul Randal ( Rand ) Howard PaulSenate GOP waves Trump off early motion to dismiss impeachment charges McConnell discounts quick dismissal of Trump impeachment articles : 'We 'll have to have a trial ' GOP motions to subpoena whistleblower MORE ( R-Ky. ) told a swarm of reporters Thursday as he tried to get into the room where he thought the bill was located . \\u201c We 're here asking for a written copy of this because this should be an open and transparent process . \\u201d\\nPaul has serious objections to multiple elements of the House GOP plan and is threatening to oppose the measure if it includes them .\\nOther Republicans are defending the process for the healthcare bill , saying members need the space to work on the measure before it is finalized and released .\\nSpeaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis Ryan Retirees should say 'no thanks ' to Romney 's Social Security plan California Governor Newsom and family dress as 2020 Democrats for Halloween DC 's liaison to rock ' n ' roll MORE ( R-Wis. ) is pushing to get healthcare legislation passed and sent to the Senate by the end of March , an aggressive timeline that will require the Republicans to begin public markups soon .\\nDemocrats complain that they are being kept in the dark about the legislation and fear they will not have enough chance to review it before a committee vote . They also note that there have not been hearings about the plan , something that traditionally happens before legislation is marked up in committee .\\nThe repeal bill is moving so quickly that the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) might not have a chance to score it before the Energy and Commerce Committee \\u2019 s vote , according to Rep. Chris Collins ( R-N.Y. ) .\\nWithout the CBO analysis , lawmakers would be voting on the measure without estimates of how much the legislation would cost or how many people could lose or gain insurance coverage .\\nThe general charge that the Republicans are moving in secret on ObamaCare repeal created a circus atmosphere in the Capitol on Thursday as a series of lawmakers arrived at a room they had heard contained the Energy and Commerce Committee 's draft bill , only to be told it was not there .\\nDemocrats soon arrived on the scene , amplifying media attention on what they view as a lack of transparency around the Republican plan .\\n`` I think they 're afraid , '' Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. ( N.J. ) , the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee , said of Republicans ' move not to release the bill yet . `` I think they 're afraid it will show that it really does n't cover most of the people that received coverage under the Affordable Care Act . ''\\nAsked why his committee would not have a hearing on the bill before the committee vote , House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady Kevin Patrick BradyLawmakers under pressure to pass benefits fix for military families How centrist Dems learned to stop worrying and love impeachment On The Money : Senate passes first spending package as shutdown looms | Treasury moves to roll back Obama rules on offshore tax deals | Trade deal talks manage to weather Trump impeachment storm MORE ( R-Texas ) on Thursday pointed to the \\u201c Better Way \\u201d healthcare plan outline that House Republicans put forward last year .\\n\\u201c This is an issue members know deep in their heart , because we \\u2019 ve been in this fight for four to six years , and last year we spent a great deal of time as House Republicans creating the Better Way blueprint on healthcare reform , \\u201d Brady told reporters . \\u201c Those elements in the blueprint have been public now since last summer . \\u201d\\nAsked if a CBO analysis of the bill , known as a score , would be ready before the committee vote , Brady did not commit , saying : \\u201c We \\u2019 re working toward having a CBO score as soon as possible . \\u201d\\nHe also defended the process as transparent and stressed that the legislation is not finished .\\n`` We don \\u2019 t have a bill , \\u201d he said . \\u201c We \\u2019 re continuing to work with CBO and our members on the final product . When we do that , when we finalize that , we will announce the markup , post that bill publicly and follow the rules of the House , which are very transparent . ''\\nHouse Democrats on Thursday distributed a timeline of their process in 2009 passing ObamaCare , noting that they released draft legislation and held hearings on it in mid-June of that year . A CBO analysis was then publicly posted at the same time as the committee votes in mid-July . The bill then did not pass the full House until November .\\nSome Republican lawmakers on Thursday , though , criticized the CBO and downplayed the importance of receiving its analysis . Rep. Markwayne Mullin ( R-Okla. ) , a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee , pointed to the way the CBO does \\u201c dynamic scoring , \\u201d which is supposed to take into account the broader economic effects of legislation .\\n\\u201c The way they do dynamic scoring , if a business did dynamic scoring the way they did it , we 'd be thrown in jail , so I do n't put a whole lot of stock in their scoring , \\u201d Mullin said . \\u201c I do like to understand where they 're coming from , though , but sometimes it does n't make any sense on how they do it . \\u201d\\nRep. Tom Cole ( R-Okla. ) added : \\u201c No offense to the CBO , they work very hard there , but I do n't think they 're very accurate a lot of times , and they operate with a lot of arcane assumptions . \\u201d\\nSome Republicans , though , are not satisfied . Rep. Michael Burgess Michael Clifton BurgessShimkus announces he will stick with plan to retire after reconsidering Shimkus says he 's reconsidering retirement Shimkus says he 's been asked to reconsider retirement MORE ( R-Texas ) , a senior member of the Energy and Commerce Committee , disagreed with the panel \\u2019 s decision to require lawmakers to go to a designated room to see the draft bill .\\n\\u201c Had anyone asked my advice : Let \\u2019 s show our work . It \\u2019 s time , \\u201d Burgess told MSNBC Wednesday night . \\u201c Put your pencils down and turn your paper in . \\u201d\\nIn response to the range of concerns on Thursday , Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden ( R-Ore. ) said in a statement that his panel is engaging in the \\u201c regular process of keeping its members up to speed on latest developments . \\u201d\\nRepublicans have for years argued that Democrats passed ObamaCare without enough of a public process , often invoking then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi \\u2019 s ( D-Calif. ) remark that \\u201c we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it . \\u201d\\nRep. Richard Neal ( D-Mass . ) , the top Ways and Means Democrat , countered Republicans Thursday by saying : \\u201c How can you read it if you can \\u2019 t even find it ? \\u201d\",\n          \"A version of Robert Mueller \\u2019 s report will be available for Congress and the public within weeks , a Justice Department official said , setting up the next phase in the highly charged fight over the special counsel \\u2019 s findings on Russian election interference .\\nThere are no plans to provide the White House with the report first , the Justice official said .\\nThe report \\u2019 s release has become a thorny political issue in Washington since Attorney General William Barr provided a summary to Congress on Sunday . Democrats have called for the release of the full report by next Tuesday , a deadline that now appears unlikely to be met . The White House has said it would defer to the Justice Department on how and whether to release the report .\\nThe report contains grand jury material , the release of which is restricted by law . Its release also could involve questions of executive privilege that would allow the White House to protect communications between the president and his advisers that may have been gathered during the 22-month investigation .\\nSince the four-page summary was released , Mr. Barr has been working with a member of Mr. Mueller \\u2019 s team and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to determine what further information he can release , based on the law and Justice Department protocol .\\nMr. Mueller \\u2019 s investigation didn \\u2019 t establish that President Trump and his 2016 campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia in its interference in the U.S. election , Mr. Barr said in his summary . Mr. Mueller didn \\u2019 t draw a conclusion on whether Mr. Trump obstructed the investigation , Mr. Barr said , noting that the report neither finds the president committed a crime nor exonerates him . Without a conclusion on obstruction of justice , Mr. Barr said he and Mr. Rosenstein determined Mr. Trump \\u2019 s actions didn \\u2019 t reach the level of criminal behavior .\\nDemocrats said they want access to the full report and its underlying materials to determine some key questions that arose from Mr. Barr \\u2019 s summary , particularly around the finding on obstruction of justice . House Democrats have said that they could issue subpoenas to obtain a full version of the report and take the matter to the Supreme Court if necessary .\\nAny consequences of missing next week \\u2019 s deadline weren \\u2019 t clear , but Democrats have indicated their interest in hearing testimony from Messrs. Barr and Mueller .\\nThe White House has signaled it doesn \\u2019 t plan to interfere in the process . Mr. Trump said Monday that it \\u201c wouldn \\u2019 t bother me at all \\u201d for the report\\u2014which he has repeatedly praised as a total exoneration , a characterization Democrats have disputed\\u2014to be released in full .\\nIt isn \\u2019 t clear whether Mr. Trump wants to assert executive privilege , which is often invoked in the interest of allowing a president to have candid discussions with advisers . Doing so would likely involve a consultation between the Justice Department and the White House Counsel \\u2019 s Office , said William Marshall , a law professor at the University of North Carolina and an expert on executive privilege .\\nSome presidents have avoided claiming the privilege to avoid political blowback from the appearance that they are hiding something , Mr. Marshall said .\\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Monday that the president was leaving it to the attorney general to decide whether to release the full report , but she suggested that protecting executive privilege was a concern in the decision . She said the White House would leave it to the attorney general to address those concerns .\\nMr. Barr could elect to consult with the White House on issues of executive privilege in the report , but it isn \\u2019 t clear whether he will do so .\\nThe Justice Department could also hold back information on national security grounds ; sources and methods used in such investigations are typically not disclosed without a fight . It could also argue some information shouldn \\u2019 t be made public because it is sensitive , without saying why it is privileged , Mr. Marshall said , which would likely spark a fight with Congress .\\nMr. Barr offered a time frame for his review during a recent phone call with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham ( R. , S.C. ) , the Justice official said .\\nMr. Graham said Tuesday that Mr. Barr needs to protect the grand jury process and make sure no sensitive intelligence or sources are disclosed , and then present that to the public .\\n\\u201c Then pretty much what is left , I would encourage [ Mr. Barr ] to turn over to the country\\u2014the good , bad , the ugly , \\u201d Mr. Graham said . \\u201c All of us want to make sure that classified information , sources and methods are protected . Beyond that , let \\u2019 s lay it out there . \\u201d\\nAt the same time , the Trump administration and Capitol Hill showed signs of turning their attention to other policy issues .\\nHouse Democratic leaders made a renewed emphasis on health care and other issues on Tuesday , returning to themes that helped the party win control of the chamber in 2018 , and they reiterated that impeachment was off the table .\\n\\u201c We \\u2019 ve never taken our focus off the for-the-people agenda , \\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D. , Calif. ) said after meeting with the Democratic caucus .\\n\\u201c I believe that the Mueller report has been done . It \\u2019 s a chapter that \\u2019 s closed , \\u201d said Rep. James Clyburn ( D. , S.C. ) , the House majority whip . He said health care is \\u201c the No . 1 thing on people \\u2019 s minds . \\u201d\\nIn a visit to the Capitol Tuesday , Mr. Trump expressed thanks to Senate Republicans who had stood by him for two years , lawmakers said , pressed the party to devise a health-care plan and to lower the cost of prescription drugs , among other issues .\\nHealth care was back in the spotlight after the Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act , in a challenge to the 2010 law brought by a group of Republican-led states . The case is on appeal , and the ACA remains in place while the litigation continues , which could be well into next year . But completely invalidating the ACA , which could leave millions without health coverage , could be a potential challenge for Republicans on the campaign trail .\\nMr. Trump \\u201c clearly wants us to come up with a Republican alternative to Obamacare depending on the outcome of the court case , \\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer ( R. , N.D. ) . Republicans repeatedly tried and failed to pass an alternative to the ACA in the first year of Mr. Trump \\u2019 s administration .\\nThe Democrats \\u2019 political recalibration\\u2014endorsed by both centrists and some in the party \\u2019 s left flank\\u2014sets up the House for a two-track approach to the current term : one in which Democratic leaders focus on a legislative agenda while key committee chairs exercise oversight of the president and investigate additional Russian interference efforts .\\n\\u201c I don \\u2019 t think that we should be running on this president , \\u201d said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D. , N.Y. ) , a prominent voice in the party \\u2019 s progressive wing . \\u201c I think we need to be running on our agenda . \\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"content_original\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 27973,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Republican leaders released on Thursday a revised plan to dismantle the Obamacare law, but it drew criticism from senators on both sides of the political divide within the Republican party, indicating a treacherous path for the bill.\\n\\nThe bill played to the party\\u2019s disparate factions by letting insurers sell cheap, bare-bones policies while retaining taxes on the wealthy.\\n\\nBut the immediate outcry illustrated the difficult political terrain that U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must navigate.

Failure would call into question his party\\u2019s ability to govern despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House.\\n\\n\\u201cSKINNY PLANS\\u201d\\n\\nThe measure represents a retreat from long-standing Republican aspirations to dump Obamacare-related taxes.\\n\\nIt retains two taxes on the wealthy that helped pay for the Obamacare law that the previous version would have repealed, and also keeps Obamacare\\u2019s limits on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry.\\n\\nThe bill included a provision allowing insurers to offer stripped-down, low-cost healthcare plans - a measure proposed by Senator Ted Cruz to try to win over holdout conservatives.\\n\\nThese \\u201cskinny plans\\u201d would not have to cover the broad benefits mandated under Obamacare like maternity and newborn care, mental health services and addiction treatment, outpatient care, hospitalization, emergency room visits and prescription drugs.\\n\\nInsurer groups, including the national Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, have derided the skinny plans, saying they would raise insurance premiums, destabilize the individual insurance market and undermine protections for pre-existing medical conditions. Moderate senators could balk at the provision for the same reasons.\\n\\nThe new bill provides an additional $70 billion to help stabilize the individual insurance market on top of the $112 billion in the original bill to help insurers slow growth in premium costs and help lower-income insurance holders cover out-of-pocket medical expenses.\\n\\nThe bill would phase out the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and disabled, and includes sharp cuts to federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025.\\n\\nModerate Republicans were spurned in their desire to see a reduction in Medicaid cuts in the revised version.\\n\\nCritics said despite some changes to coax wavering senators, the revised bill\\u2019s core remains unchanged: restructuring and cutting the critical Medicaid social safety-net program, taking away insurance from millions of Americans and driving up healthcare costs for millions of the most vulnerable Americans, especially older people and the sick.\\n\\nU.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) (C) is surrounded by reporters as he arrives for a meeting of the Senate Republican caucus for an expected unveiling of Senate Republicans' revamped proposal to replace Obamacare health care legislation at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. July 13, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\\n\\nThe revamped bill contains a provision that appears to be aimed at winning over Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a moderate who had opposed the original bill. It would funnel additional money to states that have higher insurance premiums \\u2013 at least 75 percent above the national average. Alaska is the only state with premiums that high, Senate aides said.\\n\\n\\u201cUNACCEPTABLE FLAWS\\u201d\\n\\nHospital and insurer groups have spoken out against the Senate Republican approach, particularly proposed Medicaid cuts. The cuts would result in lower revenues for hospital companies like Community Health Systems Inc and Medicaid insurance specialists like Molina Healthcare and Centene Corp.\\n\\nMolina Healthcare, which has more than 1 million customers on the Obamacare individual exchanges and manages Medicaid health programs, said the changes would leave insurers competing for the least risky customers and would make plans for sick people unaffordable.\\n\\nThe American Hospital Association said the new version of the bill retained the \\u201cunacceptable flaws\\u201d of the previous version.\\n\\n\\u201cInstead of merely putting forth an update, we again call on the Senate to put forth an upgrade,\\u201d Rick Pollack, president of the association, said in a statement.\\n\\nHealthcare stocks were mostly unmoved by the announcement, as Wall Street analysts described the core of the revised bill as largely unchanged from the earlier one.\\n\\nThe new bill includes another $45 billion for fighting the opioid addiction epidemic, on top of the $2 billion in the earlier version.\\n\\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which forecast that the previous version would have increased the number of Americans without health insurance by 22 million by 2026, is due to evaluate the new bill in coming days.\\n\\nThe Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare, expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million people, in large part by expanding Medicaid.\\n\\nThe House of Representatives on May 4 passed its own version of healthcare legislation.\\n\\nSlideshow (21 Images)\\n\\nRepublicans have a 52-48 Senate majority, with Vice President Mike Pence able to cast a potential tie-breaking vote.

Usually, the rest of the election season is just a mopping-up operation. Of course, it's been hard to find such clarity in 2016, the year that defies nearly every expectation at every turn.\\n\\nYet with the latest round of voting, we can see a trajectory and calculate a timetable for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to reach their goals: amassing the needed number of delegates before convention time.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Trump and Clinton both won Florida, North Carolina, Illinois and apparently Missouri (though the margins there are so small that The Associated Press has not yet called the race). Clinton also added the crucial state of Ohio, making for a potential sweep of events on the primary day with the second-most delegates available all year.\\n\\nIt should be noted this was the first voting day that included four top-10 states by population (Missouri is 18th). Ohio had a special significance as perhaps the pivotal contest of the night and the month \\u2014 and Clinton won there by nearly 14 points. (More about Ohio in a moment.)\\n\\nSo will Trump and Clinton ultimately be nominated? Things still may not work out that way, and powerful forces are still moving to prevent these front-runners from wrapping their respective nominations before the conventions. But stopping either of them now will require major turnarounds in momentum and math, most likely driven by some unforeseen and powerful event.\\n\\nHere's why: Clinton now owns such a lead in pledged delegates (and such an exaggerated lead among the so-called superdelegates) that only a total reversal of fortune could deny her the 2,383 delegates she needs on the first ballot in Philadelphia in July.\\n\\nIt is still mathematically possible, and states still to vote offer a little more than half the total delegate count. But rival Bernie Sanders will need to win consistently, and win with big margins, to pull even.\\n\\n\\\"This is another Super Tuesday for our campaign!\\\" shouted a hoarse Clinton to a cheering crowd in West Palm Beach, Fla. She congratulated her rival, Sanders, on his spirited challenge.\\n\\nThat challenge had taken on new force since Sanders defied the polls to win Michigan in a squeaker on March 8. His campaign had spoken of a path to winning a majority of the pledged delegates before the convention, and the next several weeks include half a dozen states where the Vermont senator is still expected to do well.\\n\\nThat list begins with Arizona on March 22, and Sanders addressed a wildly enthusiastic crowd in Phoenix on Tuesday night. Speaking for nearly an hour, Sanders visited his proven themes: Wall Street power, corruption in campaign finance, a \\\"rigged economy\\\" and income inequality. But he did not mention the results of that day's primaries.\\n\\nIn her speech, Clinton sounded as if Sanders were once again in her rearview mirror and her gaze was fixed forward on November and Trump.\\n\\n\\\"When we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants, banning all Muslims from entering the United States, when he embraces torture, that doesn't make him strong, it makes him wrong,\\\" she told the crowd.\\n\\nNot far away, at his Mar-a-Lago Club's ornate ballroom, Trump hailed his victories as well. \\\"We're going to win and win and win for our country,\\\" Trump said. He urged Republicans everywhere to unite behind his candidacy, adding that he'd had friendly telephone calls with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\\n\\n\\\"We have to bring our party together,\\\" said Trump, suddenly earnest about unity. \\\"We have something that actually makes the Republican Party probably the biggest political story in the world.\\\"\\n\\nTrump was certainly the biggest story in the Republican world again this week. Even without allocating Missouri's delegates, Trump now leads his nearest competitor by 225 delegates, with no sign of slowing down.\\n\\nIt is now all but impossible for anyone but Trump to reach the 1,237 delegates needed for nomination. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has a mathematical chance, but it is remote. No other candidate has even that.\\n\\nIn a field of Republican candidates that initially numbered 17, Trump has now outlasted all but Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who won his home state last night \\u2014 his first first-place finish of the year.\\n\\nNot so fortunate was Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, once thought the rising star of the party and the last hope of its establishment element after older and more experienced office holders fell by the wayside. Rubio had made Florida's winner-take-all primary his last stand.\\n\\nOn Tuesday night, having lost to Trump in most every demographic in a 19-point beatdown, Rubio tried to console his grieving supporters. He told them the Republican establishment had failed to understand the pent-up anger of conservatives.\\n\\n\\\"From a political standpoint, the easiest thing to have done in this campaign is to jump on all of those anxieties,\\\" Rubio said, adding that he had rejected that approach for a campaign of hope and aspiration.\\n\\n\\\"I ask the American people do not give in to the fear, do not give in to the frustration. The politics of resentment against other people will not just leave us a fractured party \\u2014 they're going to leave us a fractured nation.\\\"\\n\\nRubio made clear he would be interested in running again. But in the near term, he will need to deal with the resentment of Cruz supporters who may blame him for dividing the anti-Trump vote in recent contests. Internet threads and social media sites were filled with arguments between backers of the two rival Cuban-American candidates, born five months apart and now both first-term senators.\\n\\nNo states were called for Cruz on Tuesday night, but he did finish second in three and add modestly to his stash of delegates.\\n\\n\\\"Only two campaigns have a plausible path to the nomination: ours and Donald Trump's,\\\" Cruz said. \\\"Nobody else has any mathematical possibility whatsoever.\\\" Cruz added an appeal to those who had backed Rubio to join him.\\n\\n\\\"We welcome you with open and welcoming arms,\\\" Cruz said, inviting backers of other former candidates as well.\\n\\nNeither Trump nor Cruz seemed overly concerned with the third candidate still in the Republican race, Kasich, who remains far behind with just 138 delegates to date. Clearly, the Kasich hope is to stay alive through the remaining primaries and caucuses, winning here and there and arriving in Cleveland as the hometown \\\"favorite son\\\" in position to be a dark-horse alternative to Trump and Cruz \\u2014 both of whom are off-putting to many mainstream Republican donors and office holders.\\n\\nHe also has the benefit of representing a swing state, or what might be called the ultimate swing state. When you listen to people talk about American politics, you will hear someone say \\\"it all comes down to Ohio.\\\" Because it often does.\\n\\nMost recently, in 2004, flipping just over 100,000 votes in the Buckeye State would have made John Kerry president and denied George W. Bush a second term. And no Republican has ever won the White House without carrying Ohio. As he gave his rambling and emotional victory speech, Kasich stood under a sign that read: \\\"As Ohio Goes, So Goes the Nation.\\\"\\n\\nThat idea could also inspire the eventual Republican nominee to choose Kasich as running mate when the ticket is finally formed. That honor might also go to Rubio, whose state is even larger and more crucial in the Electoral College. But Rubio has been far more outspoken in his verbal spats with both Trump and Cruz, and might need the convention to be quite disrupted indeed before it turns to him.\",\n          \"Newtown: Victims turn lobbyists\\n\\nWhen a lobbyist for families of Newtown shooting victims called the office of Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) to set up a meeting, the first response was a standard D.C. offer. They could get a meeting with her staff, and Collins would stop by, they were told.\\n\\nThe families\\u2019 answer: not good enough. According to their lobbyists, the families have a rule against staff-only meetings: They won\\u2019t do them. They insist on sitting down with the senators themselves. The families wound up getting more than 15 minutes with Collins.\\n\\nStory Continued Below\\n\\nThat rule is just one of the ways that the Newtown families, political novices just a few months ago, are proving to be savvy, effective advocates as they promote the gun legislation that has finally begun to move through the Senate. The families are well-educated, and many are well-off. They have been polished and sharp on TV. They\\u2019re mostly non-political, but quite accomplished in their own fields. With access to money and media, they\\u2019re using persistence, visibility \\u2014 and, most all, their unique moral authority \\u2014 to help prod Senate action. They also have their own lobbyists \\u2014 several of them, in fact.\\n\\n( PHOTOS: Politicians speak out on gun control)\\n\\nThey don\\u2019t try to sound like wonks or pundits or operatives. They just tell their heart-breaking stories, weaving in a demand for action that is respectful but forceful. As a result, senators respond to them as bereaved parents, not advocates.\\n\\n\\u201cThese are smart, articulate people, who don\\u2019t have a scintilla of Washington about them,\\u201d said Matt Bennett of the centrist Democratic group Third Way, which has been helping the families navigate D.C. \\u201cBut they virtually cannot be denied a meeting. There are not many groups of people that can get a meeting with any senator they want, whenever they want.\\u201d\\n\\n( Also on POLITICO: Full coverage: Gun control debate)\\n\\nWhat started as a support group is now a lobbying force unlike any other to descend on Capitol Hill. The family members typically begin their pitch to senators softly, telling the story of the child that they lost. They gently say they could not have imagined themselves in this position, but they\\u2019re doing it to honor the memory of their children. They say they\\u2019re supporters of the Second Amendment, and just want to have a conversation.\\n\\nBut there\\u2019s nothing subtle about the way some of them conclude their visits: by leaving behind a color card with a photo of their slain relative. Nicole Hockley, who introduced President Barack Obama in Hartford this week, hands senators a card with three photos of her son Dylan, who was 6 when he was gunned down. One frame shows him grinning, in a Superman shirt.\\n\\n\\u201cDylan Hockley, 3/8/06 \\u2013 12/14/12,\\u201d the card says. \\u201cHonor his life. Stand with us for change. NOW IS THE TIME.\\u201d\\n\\n( PODCAST: \\\"The Scrum\\\" delves into gun control)\\n\\nNicole Hockley, who had worked in marketing and communications before becoming a stay-at-home mother of two, told us: \\u201cWe are there as their voices. But they have a presence in the meeting with these photo cards.\\u201d She was among the parents who accompanied Obama back to Washington on Air Force One, but the circumstances made the ride hard to enjoy. \\u201cI would rather have been at home with my two boys,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nFollow @politico\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 399,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"www.prageru.com\",\n          \"www.latimes.com\",\n          \"www.money.cnn.com\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bias_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"center\",\n          \"n4BSawmUfSId5MY0\",\n          \"left\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ID\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 27977,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tPdRPJDqFAhfS4S7\",\n          \"vTiSrifnt3H4bBKJ\",\n          \"ihOapYOLk4TDgBs6\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He is under pressure by President Donald Trump to pass a healthcare bill and make good on Republicans \\u2019 seven-year mission to gut Democratic former President Barack Obama \\u2019 s signature legislative achievement .\\n\\u201c The American people deserve better than the pain of Obamacare . They deserve better care . And the time to deliver that to them is next week , \\u201d McConnell said .\\nIn addition to the criticism from some senators , a major hospital association and one large insurer said the measure falls short in critical areas .\\nWith Democrats united against it , McConnell can not afford to lose more than two Republican senators to win passage . But moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul voiced opposition to even bringing the new plan up for debate .\\nSeveral senators said they had concerns about the legislation , particularly its Medicaid cuts , including Shelley Moore Capito , Rob Portman and John McCain . And two other Republican senators , Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy , complicated matters by announcing an alternative plan .\\nMcConnell , a skillful tactician who was forced two weeks ago to scrub a planned vote on an earlier version opposed by both moderates and hard-line conservatives in his party , has planned for a vote on the retooled bill next week .\\nThe continuing lack of consensus among Republicans on what to do with Obamacare after calling for its demise since 2010 shows that it is no sure thing that Trump \\u2019 s party will be able to get the job done .\\nHealthcare is Trump \\u2019 s first major legislative initiative . Failure would call into question his party \\u2019 s ability to govern despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House .\\nThe measure represents a retreat from long-standing Republican aspirations to dump Obamacare-related taxes .\\nIt retains two taxes on the wealthy that helped pay for the Obamacare law that the previous version would have repealed , and also keeps Obamacare \\u2019 s limits on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry .\\nThe bill included a provision allowing insurers to offer stripped-down , low-cost healthcare plans - a measure proposed by Senator Ted Cruz to try to win over holdout conservatives .\\nThese \\u201c skinny plans \\u201d would not have to cover the broad benefits mandated under Obamacare like maternity and newborn care , mental health services and addiction treatment , outpatient care , hospitalization , emergency room visits and prescription drugs .\\nInsurer groups , including the national Blue Cross Blue Shield Association , have derided the skinny plans , saying they would raise insurance premiums , destabilize the individual insurance market and undermine protections for pre-existing medical conditions . Moderate senators could balk at the provision for the same reasons .\\nThe new bill provides an additional $ 70 billion to help stabilize the individual insurance market on top of the $ 112 billion in the original bill to help insurers slow growth in premium costs and help lower-income insurance holders cover out-of-pocket medical expenses .\\nThe bill would phase out the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and disabled , and includes sharp cuts to federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025 .\\nModerate Republicans were spurned in their desire to see a reduction in Medicaid cuts in the revised version .\\nCritics said despite some changes to coax wavering senators , the revised bill \\u2019 s core remains unchanged : restructuring and cutting the critical Medicaid social safety-net program , taking away insurance from millions of Americans and driving up healthcare costs for millions of the most vulnerable Americans , especially older people and the sick .\\nU.S . Senator Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) ( C ) is surrounded by reporters as he arrives for a meeting of the Senate Republican caucus for an expected unveiling of Senate Republicans ' revamped proposal to replace Obamacare health care legislation at the U.S. Capitol in Washington , U.S. July 13 , 2017 . \\u2588\\u2588\\u2588/Jonathan Ernst\\nThe revamped bill contains a provision that appears to be aimed at winning over Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , a moderate who had opposed the original bill . It would funnel additional money to states that have higher insurance premiums \\u2013 at least 75 percent above the national average . Alaska is the only state with premiums that high , Senate aides said .\\nHospital and insurer groups have spoken out against the Senate Republican approach , particularly proposed Medicaid cuts . The cuts would result in lower revenues for hospital companies like Community Health Systems Inc and Medicaid insurance specialists like Molina Healthcare and Centene Corp .\\nMolina Healthcare , which has more than 1 million customers on the Obamacare individual exchanges and manages Medicaid health programs , said the changes would leave insurers competing for the least risky customers and would make plans for sick people unaffordable .\\nThe American Hospital Association said the new version of the bill retained the \\u201c unacceptable flaws \\u201d of the previous version .\\n\\u201c Instead of merely putting forth an update , we again call on the Senate to put forth an upgrade , \\u201d Rick Pollack , president of the association , said in a statement .\\nHealthcare stocks were mostly unmoved by the announcement , as Wall Street analysts described the core of the revised bill as largely unchanged from the earlier one .\\nThe new bill includes another $ 45 billion for fighting the opioid addiction epidemic , on top of the $ 2 billion in the earlier version .\\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , which forecast that the previous version would have increased the number of Americans without health insurance by 22 million by 2026 , is due to evaluate the new bill in coming days .\\nThe Affordable Care Act , dubbed Obamacare , expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million people , in large part by expanding Medicaid .\\nThe House of Representatives on May 4 passed its own version of healthcare legislation .\\nRepublicans have a 52-48 Senate majority , with Vice President Mike Pence able to cast a potential tie-breaking vote . Any bill passed by the Senate would have to go back to the House for approval .\\nRepealing and replacing Obamacare , which Republicans fault as a costly government intrusion into the healthcare system , was a top campaign promise for Trump , who was monitoring the Senate developments during his visit to Paris .\\n\\u201c I \\u2019 d say the only thing more difficult than peace between Israel and the Palestinians is healthcare , \\u201d Trump told reporters on his flight to Paris .\\n( Corrects 20th paragraph to show the bill applies to states with premiums at least 75 percent above the national average , not 75 percent of the national average )\",\n          \"House Republicans are coming under growing pressure to release their ObamaCare repeal and replace plan ahead of committee markups that could begin next week .\\nEven some Republican lawmakers are criticizing their party for the lack of access to the House Energy and Commerce Committee 's draft bill , which is apparently being kept in a designated room in the Capitol where entry is limited to certain members .\\n\\u201c We want to see the bill . We have many objections , \\u201d Sen. Rand Paul Randal ( Rand ) Howard PaulSenate GOP waves Trump off early motion to dismiss impeachment charges McConnell discounts quick dismissal of Trump impeachment articles : 'We 'll have to have a trial ' GOP motions to subpoena whistleblower MORE ( R-Ky. ) told a swarm of reporters Thursday as he tried to get into the room where he thought the bill was located . \\u201c We 're here asking for a written copy of this because this should be an open and transparent process . \\u201d\\nPaul has serious objections to multiple elements of the House GOP plan and is threatening to oppose the measure if it includes them .\\nOther Republicans are defending the process for the healthcare bill , saying members need the space to work on the measure before it is finalized and released .\\nSpeaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis Ryan Retirees should say 'no thanks ' to Romney 's Social Security plan California Governor Newsom and family dress as 2020 Democrats for Halloween DC 's liaison to rock ' n ' roll MORE ( R-Wis. ) is pushing to get healthcare legislation passed and sent to the Senate by the end of March , an aggressive timeline that will require the Republicans to begin public markups soon .\\nDemocrats complain that they are being kept in the dark about the legislation and fear they will not have enough chance to review it before a committee vote . They also note that there have not been hearings about the plan , something that traditionally happens before legislation is marked up in committee .\\nThe repeal bill is moving so quickly that the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) might not have a chance to score it before the Energy and Commerce Committee \\u2019 s vote , according to Rep. Chris Collins ( R-N.Y. ) .\\nWithout the CBO analysis , lawmakers would be voting on the measure without estimates of how much the legislation would cost or how many people could lose or gain insurance coverage .\\nThe general charge that the Republicans are moving in secret on ObamaCare repeal created a circus atmosphere in the Capitol on Thursday as a series of lawmakers arrived at a room they had heard contained the Energy and Commerce Committee 's draft bill , only to be told it was not there .\\nDemocrats soon arrived on the scene , amplifying media attention on what they view as a lack of transparency around the Republican plan .\\n`` I think they 're afraid , '' Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. ( N.J. ) , the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee , said of Republicans ' move not to release the bill yet . `` I think they 're afraid it will show that it really does n't cover most of the people that received coverage under the Affordable Care Act . ''\\nAsked why his committee would not have a hearing on the bill before the committee vote , House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady Kevin Patrick BradyLawmakers under pressure to pass benefits fix for military families How centrist Dems learned to stop worrying and love impeachment On The Money : Senate passes first spending package as shutdown looms | Treasury moves to roll back Obama rules on offshore tax deals | Trade deal talks manage to weather Trump impeachment storm MORE ( R-Texas ) on Thursday pointed to the \\u201c Better Way \\u201d healthcare plan outline that House Republicans put forward last year .\\n\\u201c This is an issue members know deep in their heart , because we \\u2019 ve been in this fight for four to six years , and last year we spent a great deal of time as House Republicans creating the Better Way blueprint on healthcare reform , \\u201d Brady told reporters . \\u201c Those elements in the blueprint have been public now since last summer . \\u201d\\nAsked if a CBO analysis of the bill , known as a score , would be ready before the committee vote , Brady did not commit , saying : \\u201c We \\u2019 re working toward having a CBO score as soon as possible . \\u201d\\nHe also defended the process as transparent and stressed that the legislation is not finished .\\n`` We don \\u2019 t have a bill , \\u201d he said . \\u201c We \\u2019 re continuing to work with CBO and our members on the final product . When we do that , when we finalize that , we will announce the markup , post that bill publicly and follow the rules of the House , which are very transparent . ''\\nHouse Democrats on Thursday distributed a timeline of their process in 2009 passing ObamaCare , noting that they released draft legislation and held hearings on it in mid-June of that year . A CBO analysis was then publicly posted at the same time as the committee votes in mid-July . The bill then did not pass the full House until November .\\nSome Republican lawmakers on Thursday , though , criticized the CBO and downplayed the importance of receiving its analysis . Rep. Markwayne Mullin ( R-Okla. ) , a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee , pointed to the way the CBO does \\u201c dynamic scoring , \\u201d which is supposed to take into account the broader economic effects of legislation .\\n\\u201c The way they do dynamic scoring , if a business did dynamic scoring the way they did it , we 'd be thrown in jail , so I do n't put a whole lot of stock in their scoring , \\u201d Mullin said . \\u201c I do like to understand where they 're coming from , though , but sometimes it does n't make any sense on how they do it . \\u201d\\nRep. Tom Cole ( R-Okla. ) added : \\u201c No offense to the CBO , they work very hard there , but I do n't think they 're very accurate a lot of times , and they operate with a lot of arcane assumptions . \\u201d\\nSome Republicans , though , are not satisfied . Rep. Michael Burgess Michael Clifton BurgessShimkus announces he will stick with plan to retire after reconsidering Shimkus says he 's reconsidering retirement Shimkus says he 's been asked to reconsider retirement MORE ( R-Texas ) , a senior member of the Energy and Commerce Committee , disagreed with the panel \\u2019 s decision to require lawmakers to go to a designated room to see the draft bill .\\n\\u201c Had anyone asked my advice : Let \\u2019 s show our work . It \\u2019 s time , \\u201d Burgess told MSNBC Wednesday night . \\u201c Put your pencils down and turn your paper in . \\u201d\\nIn response to the range of concerns on Thursday , Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden ( R-Ore. ) said in a statement that his panel is engaging in the \\u201c regular process of keeping its members up to speed on latest developments . \\u201d\\nRepublicans have for years argued that Democrats passed ObamaCare without enough of a public process , often invoking then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi \\u2019 s ( D-Calif. ) remark that \\u201c we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it . \\u201d\\nRep. Richard Neal ( D-Mass . ) , the top Ways and Means Democrat , countered Republicans Thursday by saying : \\u201c How can you read it if you can \\u2019 t even find it ? \\u201d\",\n          \"A version of Robert Mueller \\u2019 s report will be available for Congress and the public within weeks , a Justice Department official said , setting up the next phase in the highly charged fight over the special counsel \\u2019 s findings on Russian election interference .\\nThere are no plans to provide the White House with the report first , the Justice official said .\\nThe report \\u2019 s release has become a thorny political issue in Washington since Attorney General William Barr provided a summary to Congress on Sunday . Democrats have called for the release of the full report by next Tuesday , a deadline that now appears unlikely to be met . The White House has said it would defer to the Justice Department on how and whether to release the report .\\nThe report contains grand jury material , the release of which is restricted by law . Its release also could involve questions of executive privilege that would allow the White House to protect communications between the president and his advisers that may have been gathered during the 22-month investigation .\\nSince the four-page summary was released , Mr. Barr has been working with a member of Mr. Mueller \\u2019 s team and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to determine what further information he can release , based on the law and Justice Department protocol .\\nMr. Mueller \\u2019 s investigation didn \\u2019 t establish that President Trump and his 2016 campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia in its interference in the U.S. election , Mr. Barr said in his summary . Mr. Mueller didn \\u2019 t draw a conclusion on whether Mr. Trump obstructed the investigation , Mr. Barr said , noting that the report neither finds the president committed a crime nor exonerates him . Without a conclusion on obstruction of justice , Mr. Barr said he and Mr. Rosenstein determined Mr. Trump \\u2019 s actions didn \\u2019 t reach the level of criminal behavior .\\nDemocrats said they want access to the full report and its underlying materials to determine some key questions that arose from Mr. Barr \\u2019 s summary , particularly around the finding on obstruction of justice . House Democrats have said that they could issue subpoenas to obtain a full version of the report and take the matter to the Supreme Court if necessary .\\nAny consequences of missing next week \\u2019 s deadline weren \\u2019 t clear , but Democrats have indicated their interest in hearing testimony from Messrs. Barr and Mueller .\\nThe White House has signaled it doesn \\u2019 t plan to interfere in the process . Mr. Trump said Monday that it \\u201c wouldn \\u2019 t bother me at all \\u201d for the report\\u2014which he has repeatedly praised as a total exoneration , a characterization Democrats have disputed\\u2014to be released in full .\\nIt isn \\u2019 t clear whether Mr. Trump wants to assert executive privilege , which is often invoked in the interest of allowing a president to have candid discussions with advisers . Doing so would likely involve a consultation between the Justice Department and the White House Counsel \\u2019 s Office , said William Marshall , a law professor at the University of North Carolina and an expert on executive privilege .\\nSome presidents have avoided claiming the privilege to avoid political blowback from the appearance that they are hiding something , Mr. Marshall said .\\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Monday that the president was leaving it to the attorney general to decide whether to release the full report , but she suggested that protecting executive privilege was a concern in the decision . She said the White House would leave it to the attorney general to address those concerns .\\nMr. Barr could elect to consult with the White House on issues of executive privilege in the report , but it isn \\u2019 t clear whether he will do so .\\nThe Justice Department could also hold back information on national security grounds ; sources and methods used in such investigations are typically not disclosed without a fight . It could also argue some information shouldn \\u2019 t be made public because it is sensitive , without saying why it is privileged , Mr. Marshall said , which would likely spark a fight with Congress .\\nMr. Barr offered a time frame for his review during a recent phone call with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham ( R. , S.C. ) , the Justice official said .\\nMr. Graham said Tuesday that Mr. Barr needs to protect the grand jury process and make sure no sensitive intelligence or sources are disclosed , and then present that to the public .\\n\\u201c Then pretty much what is left , I would encourage [ Mr. Barr ] to turn over to the country\\u2014the good , bad , the ugly , \\u201d Mr. Graham said . \\u201c All of us want to make sure that classified information , sources and methods are protected . Beyond that , let \\u2019 s lay it out there . \\u201d\\nAt the same time , the Trump administration and Capitol Hill showed signs of turning their attention to other policy issues .\\nHouse Democratic leaders made a renewed emphasis on health care and other issues on Tuesday , returning to themes that helped the party win control of the chamber in 2018 , and they reiterated that impeachment was off the table .\\n\\u201c We \\u2019 ve never taken our focus off the for-the-people agenda , \\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D. , Calif. ) said after meeting with the Democratic caucus .\\n\\u201c I believe that the Mueller report has been done . It \\u2019 s a chapter that \\u2019 s closed , \\u201d said Rep. James Clyburn ( D. , S.C. ) , the House majority whip . He said health care is \\u201c the No . 1 thing on people \\u2019 s minds . \\u201d\\nIn a visit to the Capitol Tuesday , Mr. Trump expressed thanks to Senate Republicans who had stood by him for two years , lawmakers said , pressed the party to devise a health-care plan and to lower the cost of prescription drugs , among other issues .\\nHealth care was back in the spotlight after the Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act , in a challenge to the 2010 law brought by a group of Republican-led states . The case is on appeal , and the ACA remains in place while the litigation continues , which could be well into next year . But completely invalidating the ACA , which could leave millions without health coverage , could be a potential challenge for Republicans on the campaign trail .\\nMr. Trump \\u201c clearly wants us to come up with a Republican alternative to Obamacare depending on the outcome of the court case , \\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer ( R. , N.D. ) . Republicans repeatedly tried and failed to pass an alternative to the ACA in the first year of Mr. Trump \\u2019 s administration .\\nThe Democrats \\u2019 political recalibration\\u2014endorsed by both centrists and some in the party \\u2019 s left flank\\u2014sets up the House for a two-track approach to the current term : one in which Democratic leaders focus on a legislative agenda while key committee chairs exercise oversight of the president and investigate additional Russian interference efforts .\\n\\u201c I don \\u2019 t think that we should be running on this president , \\u201d said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D. , N.Y. ) , a prominent voice in the party \\u2019 s progressive wing . \\u201c I think we need to be running on our agenda . \\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bias_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"center\",\n          \"n4BSawmUfSId5MY0\",\n          \"left\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ID\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 27977,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tPdRPJDqFAhfS4S7\",\n          \"vTiSrifnt3H4bBKJ\",\n          \"ihOapYOLk4TDgBs6\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He is under pressure by President Donald Trump to pass a healthcare bill and make good on Republicans \\u2019 seven-year mission to gut Democratic former President Barack Obama \\u2019 s signature legislative achievement .\\n\\u201c The American people deserve better than the pain of Obamacare . They deserve better care . And the time to deliver that to them is next week , \\u201d McConnell said .\\nIn addition to the criticism from some senators , a major hospital association and one large insurer said the measure falls short in critical areas .\\nWith Democrats united against it , McConnell can not afford to lose more than two Republican senators to win passage . But moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul voiced opposition to even bringing the new plan up for debate .\\nSeveral senators said they had concerns about the legislation , particularly its Medicaid cuts , including Shelley Moore Capito , Rob Portman and John McCain . And two other Republican senators , Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy , complicated matters by announcing an alternative plan .\\nMcConnell , a skillful tactician who was forced two weeks ago to scrub a planned vote on an earlier version opposed by both moderates and hard-line conservatives in his party , has planned for a vote on the retooled bill next week .\\nThe continuing lack of consensus among Republicans on what to do with Obamacare after calling for its demise since 2010 shows that it is no sure thing that Trump \\u2019 s party will be able to get the job done .\\nHealthcare is Trump \\u2019 s first major legislative initiative . Failure would call into question his party \\u2019 s ability to govern despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House .\\nThe measure represents a retreat from long-standing Republican aspirations to dump Obamacare-related taxes .\\nIt retains two taxes on the wealthy that helped pay for the Obamacare law that the previous version would have repealed , and also keeps Obamacare \\u2019 s limits on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry .\\nThe bill included a provision allowing insurers to offer stripped-down , low-cost healthcare plans - a measure proposed by Senator Ted Cruz to try to win over holdout conservatives .\\nThese \\u201c skinny plans \\u201d would not have to cover the broad benefits mandated under Obamacare like maternity and newborn care , mental health services and addiction treatment , outpatient care , hospitalization , emergency room visits and prescription drugs .\\nInsurer groups , including the national Blue Cross Blue Shield Association , have derided the skinny plans , saying they would raise insurance premiums , destabilize the individual insurance market and undermine protections for pre-existing medical conditions . Moderate senators could balk at the provision for the same reasons .\\nThe new bill provides an additional $ 70 billion to help stabilize the individual insurance market on top of the $ 112 billion in the original bill to help insurers slow growth in premium costs and help lower-income insurance holders cover out-of-pocket medical expenses .\\nThe bill would phase out the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and disabled , and includes sharp cuts to federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025 .\\nModerate Republicans were spurned in their desire to see a reduction in Medicaid cuts in the revised version .\\nCritics said despite some changes to coax wavering senators , the revised bill \\u2019 s core remains unchanged : restructuring and cutting the critical Medicaid social safety-net program , taking away insurance from millions of Americans and driving up healthcare costs for millions of the most vulnerable Americans , especially older people and the sick .\\nU.S . Senator Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) ( C ) is surrounded by reporters as he arrives for a meeting of the Senate Republican caucus for an expected unveiling of Senate Republicans ' revamped proposal to replace Obamacare health care legislation at the U.S. Capitol in Washington , U.S. July 13 , 2017 . \\u2588\\u2588\\u2588/Jonathan Ernst\\nThe revamped bill contains a provision that appears to be aimed at winning over Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , a moderate who had opposed the original bill . It would funnel additional money to states that have higher insurance premiums \\u2013 at least 75 percent above the national average .

Democrats have called for the release of the full report by next Tuesday , a deadline that now appears unlikely to be met . The White House has said it would defer to the Justice Department on how and whether to release the report .\\nThe report contains grand jury material , the release of which is restricted by law . Its release also could involve questions of executive privilege that would allow the White House to protect communications between the president and his advisers that may have been gathered during the 22-month investigation .\\nSince the four-page summary was released , Mr. Barr has been working with a member of Mr. Mueller \\u2019 s team and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to determine what further information he can release , based on the law and Justice Department protocol .\\nMr. Mueller \\u2019 s investigation didn \\u2019 t establish that President Trump and his 2016 campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia in its interference in the U.S. election , Mr. Barr said in his summary . Mr. Mueller didn \\u2019 t draw a conclusion on whether Mr. Trump obstructed the investigation , Mr. Barr said , noting that the report neither finds the president committed a crime nor exonerates him . Without a conclusion on obstruction of justice , Mr. Barr said he and Mr. Rosenstein determined Mr. Trump \\u2019 s actions didn \\u2019 t reach the level of criminal behavior .\\nDemocrats said they want access to the full report and its underlying materials to determine some key questions that arose from Mr. Barr \\u2019 s summary , particularly around the finding on obstruction of justice . House Democrats have said that they could issue subpoenas to obtain a full version of the report and take the matter to the Supreme Court if necessary .\\nAny consequences of missing next week \\u2019 s deadline weren \\u2019 t clear , but Democrats have indicated their interest in hearing testimony from Messrs. Barr and Mueller .\\nThe White House has signaled it doesn \\u2019 t plan to interfere in the process . Mr. Trump said Monday that it \\u201c wouldn \\u2019 t bother me at all \\u201d for the report\\u2014which he has repeatedly praised as a total exoneration , a characterization Democrats have disputed\\u2014to be released in full .\\nIt isn \\u2019 t clear whether Mr. Trump wants to assert executive privilege , which is often invoked in the interest of allowing a president to have candid discussions with advisers . Doing so would likely involve a consultation between the Justice Department and the White House Counsel \\u2019 s Office , said William Marshall , a law professor at the University of North Carolina and an expert on executive privilege .\\nSome presidents have avoided claiming the privilege to avoid political blowback from the appearance that they are hiding something , Mr. Marshall said .\\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Monday that the president was leaving it to the attorney general to decide whether to release the full report , but she suggested that protecting executive privilege was a concern in the decision . She said the White House would leave it to the attorney general to address those concerns .\\nMr. Barr could elect to consult with the White House on issues of executive privilege in the report , but it isn \\u2019 t clear whether he will do so .\\nThe Justice Department could also hold back information on national security grounds ; sources and methods used in such investigations are typically not disclosed without a fight . It could also argue some information shouldn \\u2019 t be made public because it is sensitive , without saying why it is privileged , Mr. Marshall said , which would likely spark a fight with Congress .\\nMr. Barr offered a time frame for his review during a recent phone call with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham ( R. , S.C. ) , the Justice official said .\\nMr. Graham said Tuesday that Mr. Barr needs to protect the grand jury process and make sure no sensitive intelligence or sources are disclosed , and then present that to the public .\\n\\u201c Then pretty much what is left , I would encourage [ Mr. Barr ] to turn over to the country\\u2014the good , bad , the ugly , \\u201d Mr. Graham said . \\u201c All of us want to make sure that classified information , sources and methods are protected . Beyond that , let \\u2019 s lay it out there . \\u201d\\nAt the same time , the Trump administration and Capitol Hill showed signs of turning their attention to other policy issues .\\nHouse Democratic leaders made a renewed emphasis on health care and other issues on Tuesday , returning to themes that helped the party win control of the chamber in 2018 , and they reiterated that impeachment was off the table .\\n\\u201c We \\u2019 ve never taken our focus off the for-the-people agenda , \\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D. , Calif. ) said after meeting with the Democratic caucus .\\n\\u201c I believe that the Mueller report has been done . It \\u2019 s a chapter that \\u2019 s closed , \\u201d said Rep. James Clyburn ( D. , S.C. ) , the House majority whip . He said health care is \\u201c the No . 1 thing on people \\u2019 s minds . \\u201d\\nIn a visit to the Capitol Tuesday , Mr. Trump expressed thanks to Senate Republicans who had stood by him for two years , lawmakers said , pressed the party to devise a health-care plan and to lower the cost of prescription drugs , among other issues .\\nHealth care was back in the spotlight after the Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act , in a challenge to the 2010 law brought by a group of Republican-led states . The case is on appeal , and the ACA remains in place while the litigation continues , which could be well into next year . But completely invalidating the ACA , which could leave millions without health coverage , could be a potential challenge for Republicans on the campaign trail .\\nMr. Trump \\u201c clearly wants us to come up with a Republican alternative to Obamacare depending on the outcome of the court case , \\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer ( R. , N.D. ) . Republicans repeatedly tried and failed to pass an alternative to the ACA in the first year of Mr. Trump \\u2019 s administration .\\nThe Democrats \\u2019 political recalibration\\u2014endorsed by both centrists and some in the party \\u2019 s left flank\\u2014sets up the House for a two-track approach to the current term : one in which Democratic leaders focus on a legislative agenda while key committee chairs exercise oversight of the president and investigate additional Russian interference efforts .\\n\\u201c I don \\u2019 t think that we should be running on this president , \\u201d said Rep.

He is under pressure by President Donald Trump to pass a healthcare bill and make good on Republicans \\u2019 seven-year mission to gut Democratic former President Barack Obama \\u2019 s signature legislative achievement .\\n\\u201c The American people deserve better than the pain of Obamacare . They deserve better care . And the time to deliver that to them is next week , \\u201d McConnell said .\\nIn addition to the criticism from some senators , a major hospital association and one large insurer said the measure falls short in critical areas .\\nWith Democrats united against it , McConnell can not afford to lose more than two Republican senators to win passage . But moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul voiced opposition to even bringing the new plan up for debate .\\nSeveral senators said they had concerns about the legislation , particularly its Medicaid cuts , including Shelley Moore Capito , Rob Portman and John McCain . And two other Republican senators , Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy , complicated matters by announcing an alternative plan .\\nMcConnell , a skillful tactician who was forced two weeks ago to scrub a planned vote on an earlier version opposed by both moderates and hard-line conservatives in his party , has planned for a vote on the retooled bill next week .\\nThe continuing lack of consensus among Republicans on what to do with Obamacare after calling for its demise since 2010 shows that it is no sure thing that Trump \\u2019 s party will be able to get the job done .\\nHealthcare is Trump \\u2019 s first major legislative initiative . Failure would call into question his party \\u2019 s ability to govern despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House .\\nThe measure represents a retreat from long-standing Republican aspirations to dump Obamacare-related taxes .\\nIt retains two taxes on the wealthy that helped pay for the Obamacare law that the previous version would have repealed , and also keeps Obamacare \\u2019 s limits on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry .\\nThe bill included a provision allowing insurers to offer stripped-down , low-cost healthcare plans - a measure proposed by Senator Ted Cruz to try to win over holdout conservatives .\\nThese \\u201c skinny plans \\u201d would not have to cover the broad benefits mandated under Obamacare like maternity and newborn care , mental health services and addiction treatment , outpatient care , hospitalization , emergency room visits and prescription drugs .\\nInsurer groups , including the national Blue Cross Blue Shield Association , have derided the skinny plans , saying they would raise insurance premiums , destabilize the individual insurance market and undermine protections for pre-existing medical conditions . Moderate senators could balk at the provision for the same reasons .\\nThe new bill provides an additional $ 70 billion to help stabilize the individual insurance market on top of the $ 112 billion in the original bill to help insurers slow growth in premium costs and help lower-income insurance holders cover out-of-pocket medical expenses .\\nThe bill would phase out the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and disabled , and includes sharp cuts to federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025 .\\nModerate Republicans were spurned in their desire to see a reduction in Medicaid cuts in the revised version .\\nCritics said despite some changes to coax wavering senators , the revised bill \\u2019 s core remains unchanged : restructuring and cutting the critical Medicaid social safety-net program , taking away insurance from millions of Americans and driving up healthcare costs for millions of the most vulnerable Americans , especially older people and the sick .\\nU.S . Senator Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) ( C ) is surrounded by reporters as he arrives for a meeting of the Senate Republican caucus for an expected unveiling of Senate Republicans ' revamped proposal to replace Obamacare health care legislation at the U.S. Capitol in Washington , U.S. July 13 , 2017 . \\u2588\\u2588\\u2588/Jonathan Ernst\\nThe revamped bill contains a provision that appears to be aimed at winning over Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , a moderate who had opposed the original bill . It would funnel additional money to states that have higher insurance premiums \\u2013 at least 75 percent above the national average . Alaska is the only state with premiums that high , Senate aides said .\\nHospital and insurer groups have spoken out against the Senate Republican approach , particularly proposed Medicaid cuts .

Its release also could involve questions of executive privilege that would allow the White House to protect communications between the president and his advisers that may have been gathered during the 22-month investigation .\\nSince the four-page summary was released , Mr. Barr has been working with a member of Mr. Mueller \\u2019 s team and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to determine what further information he can release , based on the law and Justice Department protocol .\\nMr. Mueller \\u2019 s investigation didn \\u2019 t establish that President Trump and his 2016 campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia in its interference in the U.S. election , Mr. Barr said in his summary . Mr. Mueller didn \\u2019 t draw a conclusion on whether Mr. Trump obstructed the investigation , Mr. Barr said , noting that the report neither finds the president committed a crime nor exonerates him . Without a conclusion on obstruction of justice , Mr. Barr said he and Mr. Rosenstein determined Mr. Trump \\u2019 s actions didn \\u2019 t reach the level of criminal behavior .\\nDemocrats said they want access to the full report and its underlying materials to determine some key questions that arose from Mr. Barr \\u2019 s summary , particularly around the finding on obstruction of justice . House Democrats have said that they could issue subpoenas to obtain a full version of the report and take the matter to the Supreme Court if necessary .\\nAny consequences of missing next week \\u2019 s deadline weren \\u2019 t clear , but Democrats have indicated their interest in hearing testimony from Messrs. Barr and Mueller .\\nThe White House has signaled it doesn \\u2019 t plan to interfere in the process . Mr. Trump said Monday that it \\u201c wouldn \\u2019 t bother me at all \\u201d for the report\\u2014which he has repeatedly praised as a total exoneration , a characterization Democrats have disputed\\u2014to be released in full .\\nIt isn \\u2019 t clear whether Mr. Trump wants to assert executive privilege , which is often invoked in the interest of allowing a president to have candid discussions with advisers . Doing so would likely involve a consultation between the Justice Department and the White House Counsel \\u2019 s Office , said William Marshall , a law professor at the University of North Carolina and an expert on executive privilege .\\nSome presidents have avoided claiming the privilege to avoid political blowback from the appearance that they are hiding something , Mr. Marshall said .\\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Monday that the president was leaving it to the attorney general to decide whether to release the full report , but she suggested that protecting executive privilege was a concern in the decision . She said the White House would leave it to the attorney general to address those concerns .\\nMr. Barr could elect to consult with the White House on issues of executive privilege in the report , but it isn \\u2019 t clear whether he will do so .\\nThe Justice Department could also hold back information on national security grounds ; sources and methods used in such investigations are typically not disclosed without a fight . It could also argue some information shouldn \\u2019 t be made public because it is sensitive , without saying why it is privileged , Mr. Marshall said , which would likely spark a fight with Congress .\\nMr. Barr offered a time frame for his review during a recent phone call with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham ( R. , S.C. ) , the Justice official said .\\nMr. Graham said Tuesday that Mr. Barr needs to protect the grand jury process and make sure no sensitive intelligence or sources are disclosed , and then present that to the public .\\n\\u201c Then pretty much what is left , I would encourage [ Mr. Barr ] to turn over to the country\\u2014the good , bad , the ugly , \\u201d Mr. Graham said . \\u201c All of us want to make sure that classified information , sources and methods are protected . Beyond that , let \\u2019 s lay it out there . \\u201d\\nAt the same time , the Trump administration and Capitol Hill showed signs of turning their attention to other policy issues .\\nHouse Democratic leaders made a renewed emphasis on health care and other issues on Tuesday , returning to themes that helped the party win control of the chamber in 2018 , and they reiterated that impeachment was off the table .\\n\\u201c We \\u2019 ve never taken our focus off the for-the-people agenda , \\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D. , Calif. ) said after meeting with the Democratic caucus .\\n\\u201c I believe that the Mueller report has been done . It \\u2019 s a chapter that \\u2019 s closed , \\u201d said Rep. James Clyburn ( D. , S.C. ) , the House majority whip . He said health care is \\u201c the No . 1 thing on people \\u2019 s minds . \\u201d\\nIn a visit to the Capitol Tuesday , Mr. Trump expressed thanks to Senate Republicans who had stood by him for two years , lawmakers said , pressed the party to devise a health-care plan and to lower the cost of prescription drugs , among other issues .\\nHealth care was back in the spotlight after the Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act , in a challenge to the 2010 law brought by a group of Republican-led states . The case is on appeal , and the ACA remains in place while the litigation continues , which could be well into next year . But completely invalidating the ACA , which could leave millions without health coverage , could be a potential challenge for Republicans on the campaign trail .\\nMr. Trump \\u201c clearly wants us to come up with a Republican alternative to Obamacare depending on the outcome of the court case , \\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer ( R. , N.D. ) . Republicans repeatedly tried and failed to pass an alternative to the ACA in the first year of Mr. Trump \\u2019 s administration .\\nThe Democrats \\u2019 political recalibration\\u2014endorsed by both centrists and some in the party \\u2019 s left flank\\u2014sets up the House for a two-track approach to the current term : one in which Democratic leaders focus on a legislative agenda while key committee chairs exercise oversight of the president and investigate additional Russian interference efforts .\\n\\u201c I don \\u2019 t think that we should be running on this president , \\u201d said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D. , N.Y. ) , a prominent voice in the party \\u2019 s progressive wing . \\u201c I think we need to be running on our agenda . \\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He is under pressure by President Donald Trump to pass a healthcare bill and make good on Republicans \\u2019 seven-year mission to gut Democratic former President Barack Obama \\u2019 s signature legislative achievement .\\n\\u201c The American people deserve better than the pain of Obamacare . They deserve better care . And the time to deliver that to them is next week , \\u201d McConnell said .\\nIn addition to the criticism from some senators , a major hospital association and one large insurer said the measure falls short in critical areas .\\nWith Democrats united against it , McConnell can not afford to lose more than two Republican senators to win passage . But moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul voiced opposition to even bringing the new plan up for debate .\\nSeveral senators said they had concerns about the legislation , particularly its Medicaid cuts , including Shelley Moore Capito , Rob Portman and John McCain . And two other Republican senators , Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy , complicated matters by announcing an alternative plan .\\nMcConnell , a skillful tactician who was forced two weeks ago to scrub a planned vote on an earlier version opposed by both moderates and hard-line conservatives in his party , has planned for a vote on the retooled bill next week .\\nThe continuing lack of consensus among Republicans on what to do with Obamacare after calling for its demise since 2010 shows that it is no sure thing that Trump \\u2019 s party will be able to get the job done .\\nHealthcare is Trump \\u2019 s first major legislative initiative . Failure would call into question his party \\u2019 s ability to govern despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House .\\nThe measure represents a retreat from long-standing Republican aspirations to dump Obamacare-related taxes .\\nIt retains two taxes on the wealthy that helped pay for the Obamacare law that the previous version would have repealed , and also keeps Obamacare \\u2019 s limits on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry .\\nThe bill included a provision allowing insurers to offer stripped-down , low-cost healthcare plans - a measure proposed by Senator Ted Cruz to try to win over holdout conservatives .\\nThese \\u201c skinny plans \\u201d would not have to cover the broad benefits mandated under Obamacare like maternity and newborn care , mental health services and addiction treatment , outpatient care , hospitalization , emergency room visits and prescription drugs .\\nInsurer groups , including the national Blue Cross Blue Shield Association , have derided the skinny plans , saying they would raise insurance premiums , destabilize the individual insurance market and undermine protections for pre-existing medical conditions . Moderate senators could balk at the provision for the same reasons .\\nThe new bill provides an additional $ 70 billion to help stabilize the individual insurance market on top of the $ 112 billion in the original bill to help insurers slow growth in premium costs and help lower-income insurance holders cover out-of-pocket medical expenses .\\nThe bill would phase out the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and disabled , and includes sharp cuts to federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025 .\\nModerate Republicans were spurned in their desire to see a reduction in Medicaid cuts in the revised version .\\nCritics said despite some changes to coax wavering senators , the revised bill \\u2019 s core remains unchanged : restructuring and cutting the critical Medicaid social safety-net program , taking away insurance from millions of Americans and driving up healthcare costs for millions of the most vulnerable Americans , especially older people and the sick .\\nU.S . Senator Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) ( C ) is surrounded by reporters as he arrives for a meeting of the Senate Republican caucus for an expected unveiling of Senate Republicans ' revamped proposal to replace Obamacare health care legislation at the U.S. Capitol in Washington , U.S. July 13 , 2017 . \\u2588\\u2588\\u2588/Jonathan Ernst\\nThe revamped bill contains a provision that appears to be aimed at winning over Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , a moderate who had opposed the original bill . It would funnel additional money to states that have higher insurance premiums \\u2013 at least 75 percent above the national average . Alaska is the only state with premiums that high , Senate aides said .\\nHospital and insurer groups have spoken out against the Senate Republican approach , particularly proposed Medicaid cuts . The cuts would result in lower revenues for hospital companies like Community Health Systems Inc and Medicaid insurance specialists like Molina Healthcare and Centene Corp .\\nMolina Healthcare , which has more than 1 million customers on the Obamacare individual exchanges and manages Medicaid health programs , said the changes would leave insurers competing for the least risky customers and would make plans for sick people unaffordable .\\nThe American Hospital Association said the new version of the bill retained the \\u201c unacceptable flaws \\u201d of the previous version .\\n\\u201c Instead of merely putting forth an update , we again call on the Senate to put forth an upgrade , \\u201d Rick Pollack , president of the association , said in a statement .\\nHealthcare stocks were mostly unmoved by the announcement , as Wall Street analysts described the core of the revised bill as largely unchanged from the earlier one .\\nThe new bill includes another $ 45 billion for fighting the opioid addiction epidemic , on top of the $ 2 billion in the earlier version .\\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , which forecast that the previous version would have increased the number of Americans without health insurance by 22 million by 2026 , is due to evaluate the new bill in coming days .\\nThe Affordable Care Act , dubbed Obamacare , expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million people , in large part by expanding Medicaid .\\nThe House of Representatives on May 4 passed its own version of healthcare legislation .\\nRepublicans have a 52-48 Senate majority , with Vice President Mike Pence able to cast a potential tie-breaking vote . Any bill passed by the Senate would have to go back to the House for approval .\\nRepealing and replacing Obamacare , which Republicans fault as a costly government intrusion into the healthcare system , was a top campaign promise for Trump , who was monitoring the Senate developments during his visit to Paris .\\n\\u201c I \\u2019 d say the only thing more difficult than peace between Israel and the Palestinians is healthcare , \\u201d Trump told reporters on his flight to Paris .\\n( Corrects 20th paragraph to show the bill applies to states with premiums at least 75 percent above the national average , not 75 percent of the national average )\",\n          \"House Republicans are coming under growing pressure to release their ObamaCare repeal and replace plan ahead of committee markups that could begin next week .\\nEven some Republican lawmakers are criticizing their party for the lack of access to the House Energy and Commerce Committee 's draft bill , which is apparently being kept in a designated room in the Capitol where entry is limited to certain members .\\n\\u201c We want to see the bill . We have many objections , \\u201d Sen. Rand Paul Randal ( Rand ) Howard PaulSenate GOP waves Trump off early motion to dismiss impeachment charges McConnell discounts quick dismissal of Trump impeachment articles : 'We 'll have to have a trial ' GOP motions to subpoena whistleblower MORE ( R-Ky. ) told a swarm of reporters Thursday as he tried to get into the room where he thought the bill was located . \\u201c We 're here asking for a written copy of this because this should be an open and transparent process . \\u201d\\nPaul has serious objections to multiple elements of the House GOP plan and is threatening to oppose the measure if it includes them .\\nOther Republicans are defending the process for the healthcare bill , saying members need the space to work on the measure before it is finalized and released .\\nSpeaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis Ryan Retirees should say 'no thanks ' to Romney 's Social Security plan California Governor Newsom and family dress as 2020 Democrats for Halloween DC 's liaison to rock ' n ' roll MORE ( R-Wis. ) is pushing to get healthcare legislation passed and sent to the Senate by the end of March , an aggressive timeline that will require the Republicans to begin public markups soon .\\nDemocrats complain that they are being kept in the dark about the legislation and fear they will not have enough chance to review it before a committee vote . They also note that there have not been hearings about the plan , something that traditionally happens before legislation is marked up in committee .\\nThe repeal bill is moving so quickly that the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) might not have a chance to score it before the Energy and Commerce Committee \\u2019 s vote , according to Rep. Chris Collins ( R-N.Y. ) .\\nWithout the CBO analysis , lawmakers would be voting on the measure without estimates of how much the legislation would cost or how many people could lose or gain insurance coverage .\\nThe general charge that the Republicans are moving in secret on ObamaCare repeal created a circus atmosphere in the Capitol on Thursday as a series of lawmakers arrived at a room they had heard contained the Energy and Commerce Committee 's draft bill , only to be told it was not there .\\nDemocrats soon arrived on the scene , amplifying media attention on what they view as a lack of transparency around the Republican plan .\\n`` I think they 're afraid , '' Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. ( N.J. ) , the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee , said of Republicans ' move not to release the bill yet . `` I think they 're afraid it will show that it really does n't cover most of the people that received coverage under the Affordable Care Act . ''\\nAsked why his committee would not have a hearing on the bill before the committee vote , House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady Kevin Patrick BradyLawmakers under pressure to pass benefits fix for military families How centrist Dems learned to stop worrying and love impeachment On The Money : Senate passes first spending package as shutdown looms | Treasury moves to roll back Obama rules on offshore tax deals | Trade deal talks manage to weather Trump impeachment storm MORE ( R-Texas ) on Thursday pointed to the \\u201c Better Way \\u201d healthcare plan outline that House Republicans put forward last year .\\n\\u201c This is an issue members know deep in their heart , because we \\u2019 ve been in this fight for four to six years , and last year we spent a great deal of time as House Republicans creating the Better Way blueprint on healthcare reform , \\u201d Brady told reporters . \\u201c Those elements in the blueprint have been public now since last summer . \\u201d\\nAsked if a CBO analysis of the bill , known as a score , would be ready before the committee vote , Brady did not commit , saying : \\u201c We \\u2019 re working toward having a CBO score as soon as possible . \\u201d\\nHe also defended the process as transparent and stressed that the legislation is not finished .\\n`` We don \\u2019 t have a bill , \\u201d he said . \\u201c We \\u2019 re continuing to work with CBO and our members on the final product . When we do that , when we finalize that , we will announce the markup , post that bill publicly and follow the rules of the House , which are very transparent . ''\\nHouse Democrats on Thursday distributed a timeline of their process in 2009 passing ObamaCare , noting that they released draft legislation and held hearings on it in mid-June of that year .

He is under pressure by President Donald Trump to pass a healthcare bill and make good on Republicans \\u2019 seven-year mission to gut Democratic former President Barack Obama \\u2019 s signature legislative achievement .\\n\\u201c The American people deserve better than the pain of Obamacare . They deserve better care . And the time to deliver that to them is next week , \\u201d McConnell said .\\nIn addition to the criticism from some senators , a major hospital association and one large insurer said the measure falls short in critical areas .\\nWith Democrats united against it , McConnell can not afford to lose more than two Republican senators to win passage . But moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul voiced opposition to even bringing the new plan up for debate .\\nSeveral senators said they had concerns about the legislation , particularly its Medicaid cuts , including Shelley Moore Capito , Rob Portman and John McCain . And two other Republican senators , Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy , complicated matters by announcing an alternative plan .\\nMcConnell , a skillful tactician who was forced two weeks ago to scrub a planned vote on an earlier version opposed by both moderates and hard-line conservatives in his party , has planned for a vote on the retooled bill next week .\\nThe continuing lack of consensus among Republicans on what to do with Obamacare after calling for its demise since 2010 shows that it is no sure thing that Trump \\u2019 s party will be able to get the job done .\\nHealthcare is Trump \\u2019 s first major legislative initiative . Failure would call into question his party \\u2019 s ability to govern despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House .\\nThe measure represents a retreat from long-standing Republican aspirations to dump Obamacare-related taxes .\\nIt retains two taxes on the wealthy that helped pay for the Obamacare law that the previous version would have repealed , and also keeps Obamacare \\u2019 s limits on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry .\\nThe bill included a provision allowing insurers to offer stripped-down , low-cost healthcare plans - a measure proposed by Senator Ted Cruz to try to win over holdout conservatives .\\nThese \\u201c skinny plans \\u201d would not have to cover the broad benefits mandated under Obamacare like maternity and newborn care , mental health services and addiction treatment , outpatient care , hospitalization , emergency room visits and prescription drugs .\\nInsurer groups , including the national Blue Cross Blue Shield Association , have derided the skinny plans , saying they would raise insurance premiums , destabilize the individual insurance market and undermine protections for pre-existing medical conditions . Moderate senators could balk at the provision for the same reasons .\\nThe new bill provides an additional $ 70 billion to help stabilize the individual insurance market on top of the $ 112 billion in the original bill to help insurers slow growth in premium costs and help lower-income insurance holders cover out-of-pocket medical expenses .\\nThe bill would phase out the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and disabled , and includes sharp cuts to federal Medicaid spending beginning in 2025 .\\nModerate Republicans were spurned in their desire to see a reduction in Medicaid cuts in the revised version .\\nCritics said despite some changes to coax wavering senators , the revised bill \\u2019 s core remains unchanged : restructuring and cutting the critical Medicaid social safety-net program , taking away insurance from millions of Americans and driving up healthcare costs for millions of the most vulnerable Americans , especially older people and the sick .\\nU.S . Senator Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) ( C ) is surrounded by reporters as he arrives for a meeting of the Senate Republican caucus for an expected unveiling of Senate Republicans ' revamped proposal to replace Obamacare health care legislation at the U.S. Capitol in Washington , U.S. July 13 , 2017 . \\u2588\\u2588\\u2588/Jonathan Ernst\\nThe revamped bill contains a provision that appears to be aimed at winning over Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , a moderate who had opposed the original bill . It would funnel additional money to states that have higher insurance premiums \\u2013 at least 75 percent above the national average . Alaska is the only state with premiums that high , Senate aides said .\\nHospital and insurer groups have spoken out against the Senate Republican approach , particularly proposed Medicaid cuts . The cuts would result in lower revenues for hospital companies like Community Health Systems Inc and Medicaid insurance specialists like Molina Healthcare and Centene Corp .\\nMolina Healthcare , which has more than 1 million customers on the Obamacare individual exchanges and manages Medicaid health programs , said the changes would leave insurers competing for the least risky customers and would make plans for sick people unaffordable .\\nThe American Hospital Association said the new version of the bill retained the \\u201c unacceptable flaws \\u201d of the previous version .\\n\\u201c Instead of merely putting forth an update , we again call on the Senate to put forth an upgrade , \\u201d Rick Pollack , president of the association , said in a statement .\\nHealthcare stocks were mostly unmoved by the announcement , as Wall Street analysts described the core of the revised bill as largely unchanged from the earlier one .\\nThe new bill includes another $ 45 billion for fighting the opioid addiction epidemic , on top of the $ 2 billion in the earlier version .\\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , which forecast that the previous version would have increased the number of Americans without health insurance by 22 million by 2026 , is due to evaluate the new bill in coming days .\\nThe Affordable Care Act , dubbed Obamacare , expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million people , in large part by expanding Medicaid .\\nThe House of Representatives on May 4 passed its own version of healthcare legislation .\\nRepublicans have a 52-48 Senate majority , with Vice President Mike Pence able to cast a potential tie-breaking vote . Any bill passed by the Senate would have to go back to the House for approval .\\nRepealing and replacing Obamacare , which Republicans fault as a costly government intrusion into the healthcare system , was a top campaign promise for Trump , who was monitoring the Senate developments during his visit to Paris .\\n\\u201c I \\u2019 d say the only thing more difficult than peace between Israel and the Palestinians is healthcare , \\u201d Trump told reporters on his flight to Paris .\\n( Corrects 20th paragraph to show the bill applies to states with premiums at least 75 percent above the national average , not 75 percent of the national average )\",\n          \"GOP takes heat for ObamaCare secrecy House Republicans are coming under growing pressure to release their ObamaCare repeal and replace plan ahead of committee markups that could begin next week .\\nEven some Republican lawmakers are criticizing their party for the lack of access to the House Energy and Commerce Committee 's draft bill , which is apparently being kept in a designated room in the Capitol where entry is limited to certain members .\\n\\u201c We want to see the bill .

They also note that there have not been hearings about the plan , something that traditionally happens before legislation is marked up in committee .\\nThe repeal bill is moving so quickly that the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) might not have a chance to score it before the Energy and Commerce Committee \\u2019 s vote , according to Rep. Chris Collins ( R-N.Y. ) .\\nWithout the CBO analysis , lawmakers would be voting on the measure without estimates of how much the legislation would cost or how many people could lose or gain insurance coverage .\\nThe general charge that the Republicans are moving in secret on ObamaCare repeal created a circus atmosphere in the Capitol on Thursday as a series of lawmakers arrived at a room they had heard contained the Energy and Commerce Committee 's draft bill , only to be told it was not there .\\nDemocrats soon arrived on the scene , amplifying media attention on what they view as a lack of transparency around the Republican plan .\\n`` I think they 're afraid , '' Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. ( N.J. ) , the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee , said of Republicans ' move not to release the bill yet . `` I think they 're afraid it will show that it really does n't cover most of the people that received coverage under the Affordable Care Act .

If he follows through on his pledge for mass deportations and tighter immigration policies, it could create a financial burden for many Americans. Thats because immigrants including people who are in America illegally support the job market, keep inflation in check and add to the federal coffers. That contributes to the overall US economy If current immigration levels are sustained, the countrys real gross domestic product GDP could increase by 02 percentage points each year over the next decade, leaving it 2 higher in 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Offices outlook report for the next decade. By contrast, that projected growth would take a hit if Trump were able to enact his mass deportation plans. An estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants reside in the United States, but Trumps focus has mostly been on deporting immigrants with criminal records. Goldman Sachs reported in June that it estimates about 12 million unauthorized immigrants, or 8 of that population, have criminal convictions. Heres the financial impact for Americans if Trump follows through on his mass deportation plan. Higher prices Deporting millions of undocumented workers would mean that businesses will need to replace those laborers. With historically low unemployment, finding people willing to work for low pay could be difficult, and companies may need to advertise higher wages to attract workers to replace deported laborers. Consumers would foot the bill if companies productivity slows or paychecks increase in the agriculture, construction and services sectors, which have a large number of undocumented workers. The University of New Hampshire Carsey School of Public Policy reported that the supply of goods would take a hit, similar to what happened during the pandemic. The report noted that inflation could peak at 05 percentage points higher under a mass deportation plan. Job growth will slow If huge populations of migrants are deported or at the very least population growth slows as a result of tighter immigration policies there will be less consumption of goods, which could hurt the labor market. Businesses would likely crack down on hiring due to a drop in revenue. Decreased consumer spending and demand could also lead to layoffs, as companies reassess their 2025 budgets, according to a Brookings Institute report. If there is negative net migration in 2025, the Brookings Institute estimates job growth would reduce by about 100000 a month. Lower pay Even as some people who fill the jobs left by deported laborers could get higher pay than the people they replace, in aggregate, deportations can lower paychecks for US-born workers. Between 2008 and 2015, wages for US-born workers decreased 06 after the deportation of 454000 unauthorized immigrant workers, according to a report by the University of New Hampshire Carsey School of Public Policy. What do you think Join 167 others in the comments View Comments The report said with fewer people consuming goods, job losses mounted across all skill levels, which offset gains by US-born low-skilled workers. Goldman Sachs said in a recent report that moderate fluctuations in immigration would likely have little impact on wage growth and inflation. The opposite would happen if there were dramatic policy changes. Social safety nets will take a hit If a large number of unauthorized workers are deported, it would cause funding problems for key federal programs. The American Immigration Council estimated in 2022 that unauthorized immigrants contributed 468 billion in federal taxes, with 226 billion going to Social Security and 57 billion going to Medicare. Unauthorized immigrants also paid 293 billion in state and local taxes. The deportation plan itself could be enormously expensive. Trump recently told NBC News that its not a question of a price tag for his plans for militarized deportations. The average cost of apprehending, detaining, processing and removing one undocumented immigrant in 2016 was 10900, according to figures released by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE at the time. That year, ICE said the average cost of transporting one deportee to their home country was 1978. Since then, the costs have grown.\"]\n",

            "Text: Trump declaring national emergency at border would not lead to militarization of country expert says Fears over Presidentelect Trumps plan to declare a state of emergency at the border and make use of the military as part of a mass deportation plan have been overblown according to one expert The country is not going to be militarized Alfonso Aguilar a former chief of the US Office of Citizenship and the director of Hispanic engagement at the American Principles Project told Fox News Digital Neighborhoods with immigrants are not going to militarize The comments come after Trump confirmed Monday via Truth Social a report that he is prepared to declare a national emergency and will use military assets to reverse the Biden invasion through a mass deportation program The American people reelected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail He will deliver Karoline Leavitt a spokesperson for the Trump transition team told Fox News Digital Such plans have been rumored for much of Trumps campaign raising fears among some critics that a future Trump administration would deploy the military onto American streets They are promising to use the military to do mass raids of American families at a scale that harkens back to some of the worst things our country has done Todd Schulte the president of FWDus an immigration advocacy organization told The Associated Press in October But Aguliar argued that the military is to play a support role providing logistics support to the US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement ICE and US Customs and Border Protection CBP There is a lot of fearmongering from the left and many in the media Aguliar said These are not going to be sweeps of neighborhoods these are going to be targeted arrests initially going after criminals I would anticipate that the military would participate in a supportive capacity he continued Youre detaining people youre going to need to move these people and provide shelter Aguilar pointed out that federal law limits how Trump can use the military domestically meaning ICE officers are likely to lead deportation efforts with a logistical hand from the military On the border the military would serve as a show of force while also helping be the eyes and ears for Border Patrol officers who are stretched thin across multiple sectors Thats historically how we use the military Aguliar said Force projection to dissuade people from coming in but their role is basically to help detect helping move migrants to buses all the logistical support Aguliar also argued that ICE is likely to make wider use of workplace raids where again the militarys logistical might could be harnessed to assist with detaining and transporting arrested migrants Theyre not going to set loose the military in neighborhoods trying to detect illegal immigrants Aguliar said Meanwhile many blue state leaders have announced plans to push back against Trumps deportations plans with Massachusetts Gov Maura Healey saying she is prepared to use every tool in the tool box to protect the states migrant residents and Illinois Gov JB Pritzker vowing to do everything that I can to protect our undocumented immigrants We cannot prohibit them federal law enforcement from coming into our state to you know conduct raids or do anything else like that Pritzker said last week Meanwhile I think it would be very difficult for them to just spread out across the country They dont have enough manpower within the Department of Homeland Security in order to carry that out\n",

        "example_texts=[ \"4 ways Trumps mass deportation plans could hurt your finances President-elect Donald Trump has made tougher immigration enforcement a key campaign promise in each of his White House bids. If he follows through on his pledge for mass deportations and tighter immigration policies, it could create a financial burden for many Americans. Thats because immigrants including people who are in America illegally support the job market, keep inflation in check and add to the federal coffers. That contributes to the overall US economy If current immigration levels are sustained, the countrys real gross domestic product GDP could increase by 02 percentage points each year over the next decade, leaving it 2 higher in 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Offices outlook report for the next decade. By contrast, that projected growth would take a hit if Trump were able to enact his mass deportation plans. An estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants reside in the United States, but Trumps focus has mostly been on deporting immigrants with criminal records. Goldman Sachs reported in June that it estimates about 12 million unauthorized immigrants, or 8 of that population, have criminal convictions. Heres the financial impact for Americans if Trump follows through on his mass deportation plan. Higher prices Deporting millions of undocumented workers would mean that businesses will need to replace those laborers. With historically low unemployment, finding people willing to work for low pay could be difficult, and companies may need to advertise higher wages to attract workers to replace deported laborers. Consumers would foot the bill if companies productivity slows or paychecks increase in the agriculture, construction and services sectors, which have a large number of undocumented workers. The University of New Hampshire Carsey School of Public Policy reported that the supply of goods would take a hit, similar to what happened during the pandemic. The report noted that inflation could peak at 05 percentage points higher under a mass deportation plan. Job growth will slow If huge populations of migrants are deported or at the very least population growth slows as a result of tighter immigration policies there will be less consumption of goods, which could hurt the labor market. Businesses would likely crack down on hiring due to a drop in revenue. Decreased consumer spending and demand could also lead to layoffs, as companies reassess their 2025 budgets, according to a Brookings Institute report. If there is negative net migration in 2025, the Brookings Institute estimates job growth would reduce by about 100000 a month. Lower pay Even as some people who fill the jobs left by deported laborers could get higher pay than the people they replace, in aggregate, deportations can lower paychecks for US-born workers. Between 2008 and 2015, wages for US-born workers decreased 06 after the deportation of 454000 unauthorized immigrant workers, according to a report by the University of New Hampshire Carsey School of Public Policy. What do you think Join 167 others in the comments View Comments The report said with fewer people consuming goods, job losses mounted across all skill levels, which offset gains by US-born low-skilled workers. Goldman Sachs said in a recent report that moderate fluctuations in immigration would likely have little impact on wage growth and inflation. The opposite would happen if there were dramatic policy changes. Social safety nets will take a hit If a large number of unauthorized workers are deported, it would cause funding problems for key federal programs. The American Immigration Council estimated in 2022 that unauthorized immigrants contributed 468 billion in federal taxes, with 226 billion going to Social Security and 57 billion going to Medicare. Unauthorized immigrants also paid 293 billion in state and local taxes. The deportation plan itself could be enormously expensive. Trump recently told NBC News that its not a question of a price tag for his plans for militarized deportations. The average cost of apprehending, detaining, processing and removing one undocumented immigrant in 2016 was 10900, according to figures released by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE at the time. That year, ICE said the average cost of transporting one deportee to their home country was 1978. Since then, the costs have grown.\"]\n",

Thats because immigrants including people who are in America illegally support the job market, keep inflation in check and add to the federal coffers. That contributes to the overall US economy If current immigration levels are sustained, the countrys real gross domestic product GDP could increase by 02 percentage points each year over the next decade, leaving it 2 higher in 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Offices outlook report for the next decade. By contrast, that projected growth would take a hit if Trump were able to enact his mass deportation plans. An estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants reside in the United States, but Trumps focus has mostly been on deporting immigrants with criminal records. Goldman Sachs reported in June that it estimates about 12 million unauthorized immigrants, or 8 of that population, have criminal convictions. Heres the financial impact for Americans if Trump follows through on his mass deportation plan. Higher prices Deporting millions of undocumented workers would mean that businesses will need to replace those laborers. With historically low unemployment, finding people willing to work for low pay could be difficult, and companies may need to advertise higher wages to attract workers to replace deported laborers. Consumers would foot the bill if companies productivity slows or paychecks increase in the agriculture, construction and services sectors, which have a large number of undocumented workers. The University of New Hampshire Carsey School of Public Policy reported that the supply of goods would take a hit, similar to what happened during the pandemic. The report noted that inflation could peak at 05 percentage points higher under a mass deportation plan. Job growth will slow If huge populations of migrants are deported or at the very least population growth slows as a result of tighter immigration policies there will be less consumption of goods, which could hurt the labor market. Businesses would likely crack down on hiring due to a drop in revenue. Decreased consumer spending and demand could also lead to layoffs, as companies reassess their 2025 budgets, according to a Brookings Institute report. If there is negative net migration in 2025, the Brookings Institute estimates job growth would reduce by about 100000 a month. Lower pay Even as some people who fill the jobs left by deported laborers could get higher pay than the people they replace, in aggregate, deportations can lower paychecks for US-born workers. Between 2008 and 2015, wages for US-born workers decreased 06 after the deportation of 454000 unauthorized immigrant workers, according to a report by the University of New Hampshire Carsey School of Public Policy. What do you think Join 167 others in the comments View Comments The report said with fewer people consuming goods, job losses mounted across all skill levels, which offset gains by US-born low-skilled workers. Goldman Sachs said in a recent report that moderate fluctuations in immigration would likely have little impact on wage growth and inflation. The opposite would happen if there were dramatic policy changes. Social safety nets will take a hit If a large number of unauthorized workers are deported, it would cause funding problems for key federal programs. The American Immigration Council estimated in 2022 that unauthorized immigrants contributed 468 billion in federal taxes, with 226 billion going to Social Security and 57 billion going to Medicare. Unauthorized immigrants also paid 293 billion in state and local taxes. The deportation plan itself could be enormously expensive. Trump recently told NBC News that its not a question of a price tag for his plans for militarized deportations. The average cost of apprehending, detaining, processing and removing one undocumented immigrant in 2016 was 10900, according to figures released by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE at the time. That year, ICE said the average cost of transporting one deportee to their home country was 1978. Since then, the costs have grown.\"]\n",
